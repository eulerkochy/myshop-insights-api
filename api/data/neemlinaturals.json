This luxurious blend cools the scalp with peppermint oil, reducing excess oil, dandruff & itching. Rosemary curbs sebum production while jojoba soothes redness. Enriched with almond and lemon oil, it nourishes damaged hair, leaving it strong, shiny, and rejuvenated. Experience the soothing embrace of natural care. MRP: Rs. 1,150 ₹ 1,150 ₹ 690 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works Neemli Rosemary and Jojoba Oil helps restore scalp health and nourish hair Rosemary essential oil reduces excess oil and impurities that can clog hair follicles Organic jojoba oil's anti-inflammatory properties relieve itching and redness Enriched with sweet almond oil, peppermint and lemon essential oil for added nourishment Enriched formula that can soothe and moisturize the scalp, providing relief to those with psoriasis-related dryness and itchiness Made with the highest-grade organic ingredients with no fillers Free from sulphates, parabens, petroleum, formaldehyde, PEGS, artificial colour and synthetic fragrances Not tested on animals Benefits Dandruff control: If your scalp is flaking because of dry skin and not an underlying medical condition, natural moisturizing oils help keep the scalp hydrated, reducing the presence of white flakes. With its strong anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, this hair oil helps clear dandruff causing impurities and relieves scalp from itchiness and redness. Curbing Excess Oil Production: While it may seem counter-intuitive to use a hair oil to deal with an oily scalp, this blend can actually help in countering the issue by balancing your scalp’s natural oil production. Rosemary essential oil in conjunction with jojoba oil balances the scalp’s sebum production while moisturizing the scalp. This not only curtails excess oil production, but also helps guard against environmental factors that lead to greasiness. Promoting Hair Growth: This blend of vitamin-rich natural oils helps with hair strengthening and growth. Rosemary oil is known to lower DHT, a hormone that causes hair follicles to shrink, improving growth and reducing premature graying. Other ingredients like sweet almond oil – rich in B vitamins and antioxidant-rich olive oil boost hair and scalp strength, promoting hair growth. How to Use Comb through your hair so that it’s smooth and free from tangles Take about one teaspoon of the oil and massage into the scalp using your fingertips or a piece of cotton to stimulate hair follicles Depending on your hair type, apply some on hair strands (for dry hair) or focus on the scalp (for oily hair) Leave on for a minimum of 20 minutes or overnight for best results Wash off the oil with a natural shampoo to reveal shiny, healthier hair!

I Indu Customer review i have had dandruff problems since ive been a kid. after using this oil i felt an instant relief from itchiness and dandruff, so from then ive used it once a week, mostly while doing a head massage. After sometime Ive realised not to use too much at a time as product is expensive and it will get over fast, so i use little with another oil to make it last longer, because i don't want it to finish. It is too soothing, almost like a natural and very good quality navratna oil. J Jeju Chaterjee Customer review The oil is good and feels natural. T T. My absolute favourite I absolutely love this product! It really works on my over sensitive scalp. Can’t wait for it to be back in stock!

Customer Reviews Customer Reviews Based on 103 reviews Write a review 76% (78) 17% (18) 1% (1) 2% (2) 4% (4) p paulineparveen Customer review The best vitamin c and hyaluronic serum I have ever used. I have used a lot of vitamin c serum prescribed by my Dermat but none of them showed results on my skin except this magic potion introduced by Neemli. My dark spots have faded a lot, this is my second bottle. The price is totally worth this serum but I hope you don't increase the price further. My words will fall short about its marvellous effect on my skin. The only thing I can do is to Thank Neemli for introducing us to such a wonderful product. \"Miracle in a tiny bottle.\" Being a Doctor myself I would recommend this serum to everyone. P.S. I have already asked my friends and colleagues in my Hospital to try this as they have been asking me the secret to my faded blemishes. Thank you Neemliâ¤ï¸ r rainadams23 Customer review I have been using this serum for a month now. It has the 'freshest' fragrance ever?. And it does work wonders...it takes time though. It really did smoothen and firm up my skin. I dont use foundation at all, so the serum did give me a glow, making me happy about no makeup, but just serum and suncreen?â¤ J Jayanti Bhasker Customer review This serum works. I was hesitant to buy it initially coz of its high price but its all worth it. Consistent use for over 10 days begun showing its effect. My skin looked glowy and moisturized. I use it religiously now and encourage everyone who listens to buy. We don't need Korean, American skincare brands. Indian brands are the very best, and I am not saying it out of misplaced pride but because the home-grown brands know much better the needs of Indian skin. D Dr Suhasini Shankar Good for healthy skin formulation is mild and feels good on skin, i feel the product has helped keep my skin texture healthy S Shriti Das Customer review I am 31 with fairly good but dry skin. This is the first HA + Vit C product that I have used. It does glide on beautifully but then my skin feels stretchy. I do use it under a moisturiser followed by sunscreen but the moisturiser takes some work to get absorbed after using the serum. I use it on my skin immediately after cleansing in a steamy bathroom. It did cause purging on my skin for 6-7 weeks in the form of tiny bumps and 2 pimples. The 2 pimples have left a scar and that's okay, hopefully it will disappear. But right now, post 2 months my dark spots have evened out and my skin is glowing. Having said that, I do have absolutely non-problematic skin and no product has ever caused any allergy, so I am guessing that the pimples and bumps were a part of the cell-turnover, purging whatever it is. But now my skin looks nicer, hydrated and plump even on days when I don't drink water (which is NOT a reason to not drink water) but you get my point right! So I am taking away 1-star for the stretchy feeling and I feel bad about it but overall it's a great product to start with a Vit C routine. 1 2 3 This is just a placeholder image.

I was using Drunk Elephant Protini, prior to this cream. It took my skin a month to adjust to the difference but after that happened it's been smooth sailing. I have ultra ultra sensitive skin and this cream has been an angel. It never irritates my skin and has the perfect amount of moisture without-out feeling heavy on your skin. I use it in the morning and night, it's truly wonderful and soothing to my skin. My only complaint is every single jar after my first jar I have received with a broken or cracked cap. I've just been lucky that I never threw out my first jar so I switched out the cap. Neemli Naturals this cream is absolutely amazing but dear god please fix your packaging!

I'm on my 7th bottle and I ended up using it because my sister didn't seem to like it at all J Jolenta Customer review Magical potion for the skin. Having sensitive skin that also was laden with acne scars, I decided to try this oil since I had heard about the great reviews. Trust me, it's not an overnight wonder, but a process. I noticed a glow on my skin within a week but thought I was just imagining it. A few weeks later my mother noticed my skin and gave me compliment. It has lightened a 80% scars on my face. The skin feels super radiant post using this product. It doesn't clog pores and has an ayurvedic kind of smell (some like it, some don't) This is one of my holy grail skin care products. P Prashasthi Bhat Customer review I find this facial oil very calming and I use it every 2/3 days a week. Being a skincare junkie, I also use this facial oil with powder facemasks which are otherwise too drying. Overall, a good product that delivers nourishment. 1 2 3 This is just a placeholder image.

Hydrated skin is healthy skin and nothing can do it better than the Neemli Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer. With its lightweight texture and fast-absorbing formula, this moisturizer is non-comedogenic and helps control oil production, leaving your skin well balanced, hydrated, plump and youthful. MRP: Rs. 975 10ml 50ml ₹ 975 ₹ 585 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works Sometimes, the loss of moisture can increase oil production in the skin leading to shiny, clogged skin. External aggressors including pollution and UV rays can damage the skin’s moisture barrier causing moisture to escape and irritants to enter leading to dryness, itchiness, breakouts and fine lines. The right moisturizer will help repair the damaged moisture barrier, improving skin hydration without clogging pores. Hyaluronic acid acts as a sponge, pulling water from the environment into the skin and repairing the skin’s barrier. Hyaluronic acid helps in softening fine lines and making skin look firmer while smoothing out dry, rough patches. It also plumps and adds volume to skin cells, giving it a more radiant appearance. Oat amino acids have pH balancing properties that add moisture and sooth the skin, while protecting against the detrimental effects of environmental exposure. Together with soothing aloe vera and antioxidant rich Niacinamide, this moisturizer not only protects from moisture loss, but also guards against chemical and UV damage, balancing oiliness and improving skin resistance. The Neemli Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer is not tested on animals. It is free from animal derived raw materials, sulphates, parabens and artificial fragrance. Normal Combination to Oily Skin Benefits Skin Hydration & Moisture Retention : Hyaluronic acid is one of the best hydrating agents, attracting water into the skin. This makes skin moisturized and plumped, reducing fine lines, wrinkles and sagging without any greasiness. Oat Amino Acid, rich in lipids, can easily penetrate the skin and provide enhanced moisturization. When used after a shower, this moisturizer also helps trap and retain moisture in the skin, leaving it feeling soft and supple all day. Maintaining Skin Elasticity : As we age, our skin loses moisture. When you put hyaluronic acid back into the skin, it helps in restoring and replenishing its supply. This leads to improved elasticity and moisturized, firm and supple skin with reduced fine lines and wrinkles. How to Use When used as part of your daily skincare routine, use this moisturizer as a third step after cleansing and toning Take a small amount and use the tips of your fingers to massage onto skin in an upward motion Use daily for best results Ingredients List Aqua,Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice C12 C15 Alkyl ester, Soy Lecithin, Dimethicone, Vetiver Hydrosol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Rose Water, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Oat Amino Acids, Lecithin, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate , Lysolecithin, Niacinamide , 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid , Phenethyl Alcohol , Bisabolol , Caprylhydroxamic Acid , Tocopheryl Acetate, Phytic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate & Pottasium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane Benzophenone-3 & Phospholipids & 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Methyl undeclynate.

MRP: Rs. 950 ₹ 950 ₹ 570 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works PUT YOUR BEST FACE FORWARD! When we’re young with naturally smooth skin, breakouts and rough skin seem like things that can’t touch us. As we age, a variety of factors including hormonal changes and environmental aggressors get in the way of soft, clear skin. The Neemli Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash is specifically designed for those with oily, combination and acne-prone skin looking for a gentle cleanser that helps reduce breakouts without stripping the skin of its natural oils. With its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, tea tree oil helps reduce sebum production and fight acne while salicylic acid deep cleans the skin, removing dirt and bacteria while also preventing future breakouts. Also enriched with exfoliating glycolic acid and soothing aloe vera, this face wash deeply cleanses skin and leaves it looking fresh, hydrated and clear. The Neemli Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash is not tested on animals. It is free from animal derived raw materials, sulphates, parabens, silicones and fragrance. Benefits Reducing & Preventing Acne: A natural antiseptic, tea tree oil prevents microbial growth, working its way into the pores to disinfect skin. This helps destroy acne-causing bacteria while treating inflammation, soothing skin and even and working on marks. Salicylic acid penetrates the skin deeply, dissolving debris that clogs pores to sooth inflammed breakouts. This face wash works effectively to not only reduce already present acne but also prevent further breakouts. Balancing Oil Production: With its ability to penetrate through the lipid barrier of our skin, salicylic acid helps in reducing and balancing oil production. This leads to lesser breakouts caused by overactive oil glands. Acting as a natural moisturizer, tea tree oil restores the skin’s natural oil balance, while keeping it hydrated and healthy. Skin Protection: Tea tree oil is a natural source of antioxidants that helps neutralize free radicals present in the skin and in the outside environment. This prevents damage to healthy skin cells.

It stimulates collagen production, accelerating skin renewal and reducing the effects of aging while targeting uneven skin texture and age spots. Infused with peptide complex, this serum also helps firm and lift skin, giving it a plump, restored look. Firming And Lifting Skin : Peptides, or the blocks that make up protein, easily penetrate the skin and signal it to repair itself, which leads to a boost of collagen production. Consistent use of this effective serum leads to increased elasticity making skin firm, smooth and plump. Combating Hyperpigmentation : One of the most important benefits of retinol is its ability to increase cell turnover. This serum provides a fastened renewal effect, which means that over time, pigmented cells get replaced with new skin cells, combating different forms of hyperpigmentation including sun spots and age spots as well as fine lines and wrinkles. Combined with peptides, this serum helps boost overall collagen production, reducing the appearance of pores and dark patches while brightening skin. Brightening And Acne Control : This serum enriched with retinol, exfoliates at a cellular level, brightening dull skin and revealing smooth, healthy skin. It also stops pores from clogging, controlling acne and normalizing cell turnover. Hyaluronic Acid provides long-lasting hydration and Niacinamide or Vitamin B3 helps your skin grow a ceramide barrier, which evens out skin tone, giving you a balanced complexion. How to Use This serum is best used as a night repair treatment Use 2 – 4 drops of serum on cleansed, toned face and neck Massage it in and leave it on Apply moisturizer and other creams after applying serum Ease into the treatment by applying it 3-4 times a week, gradually building to daily use Wake up with tighter, brighter skin! *Caution: It is advised not to be used during pregnancy Ingredients List DM Water, Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate Encapsulated, Glyceryl sterate citrate, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate, Lysolecithin , Niacinamide , 3-O- Ethyl Ascorbic Acid , Phenethyl Alcohol , Bisabolol , Caprylhydroxamic Acid , Tocopheryl Acetate , Phytic Acid , Caprylyl Glycol, Oat Amino Acid, Hexanoyl Dipeptide-3 Norleucine Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, SorbitolHyaluronic Acid, (Myrciaria dubia)Camu Camu extract,Lysolecithin , Sclerotium Gum , Xanthan Gum , Pullulan,Allantoin, Sea Plankthon water,Licorice Extract,Oryza Sative(Rice) Water,Sodium levullinate and pottasium sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice, Essential Oils Blend.

It feels like it's a serum and moisturiser in one and i don't feel the need to use anything else after, pricingwise I'd say it's high but compared to the the loccitanes and lancomes this is still great value for money D Dr.saminah khan Customer review I have used 3 bottles of this product and find a remarkable change in my skin. Fine lines have diminished..skin looks fresh and radiant. The scars and pigments have vanished. It gets easily absorbed. Can't stop using it. Thanks neemli N Neha Customer review I had been looking for a serum to help me with my wisdom skin. I am 44 years old. I recently started an Instagram account and it was filled with at least 20-30 good products, all claiming to be the best leaving me ina dilemma to choose. I researched the ingredients and their % that would suit me and are required by my skin; Retinol being one of them, Vitamin C being another. I have tried a lot of other products and I had reached a point where I didn't want to invest any more money on experimenting. Then I came across an ad for Neemli and I liked the fact they didn't use a 20-year-old to publicize an aging skin care product. And to top it all there was a discount *wink wink* i took a chance and ordered my first Neemli product. I have to say I am not at all disappointed. The results were amazing. As compared to other creams and serums I have used in the past- No break outs, it doesn't hurt the eyes, it gets absorbed in skin, not greasy, no residue. My skin feels like a baby's bottom. I have just started using it, will come back for more results. If the discount comes back I am being another one for backup. S Snigdha Das Retinol & Peptide Serum (30ml) S Snehal Bandivadekar Go for it! I was a bit skeptical about introducing my skin to retinol however Im glad i made my first purchase with Neemli. Love how easy it is to add to your routine, just slap on some sunscreen after. My skin definitely looks revived within 2 weeks of usage! 1 2 3 This is just a placeholder image.

Our Glycolic & Salicylic Serum is a multi-functional superstar that doesn’t just control bacteria and clear dead skin cells, but also soothes with minimal irritation to sensitive skin with its unique botanical formula. With exfoliating glycolic acid and dirt-destroying salycylic acid, this serum works synergistically to alleviate clogged pores, blackheads and acne giving you clearer, brighter and more radiant skin. MRP: Rs. 1,950 5ml 15ml 30ml ₹ 1,950 ₹ 1,170 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works The Neemli Glycolic & Salicylic Acid Serum is an effective formula that refreshes the skin and keeps breakouts at bay. The serum contains glycolic acid, which sloughs away dead skin cells and treats pigmentation, and salicylic acid, which pulls out excess dirt and sebum. The formula is enhanced with other anti-microbial, soothing ingredients like taraktogenos kurzii seed oil, magnolia bark extract and witch hazel water. The serum is gentle and effective for acne-prone, oily, and troublesome skin. The product is not tested on animals and is free from animal-derived raw materials, parabens, propylene glycol, and fragrance. Benefits Treating Acne : Salicylic acid has the unique ability to go deep into the skin and pull out excess dirt and sebum. Being naturally anti-inflammatory, it helps to normalize keratinization or the bonding together of dead skin cells, reducing future acne and breakouts. Unclogging Pores : When dead skin cells mix up with our skin’s natural oil, our pores tend to look bigger and stretched. Glycolic acid helps in exfoliating the top layer of the skin, decreasing the amount of dead skin cells getting trapped inside the pore. On the other hand, being oil-soluble salycylic acid reaches deep inside pores, loosening up clogs and making them appear smaller. Balancing Excessive Oil Production : One of the few ingredients that actually slow down your skin’s oil production, salicylic acid reduces sebum secretion, keeping your natural skin oil in balance while glycolic acid reduces excessive oil production and clogged pores, maintaining smooth and balanced skin. How to Use This serum is best used as a night repair treatment Use 2 – 3 drops of serum on cleansed, toned face and neck Massage it in and leave it on Apply moisturizer and other creams after applying serum Not to be used in the day.

The second step in a good, basic skincare routine, toning is a process of quickly absorbing excess dirt, impurities and leftover makeup traces. It brings the skin back to its acidic state by removing dead cells off your skin surface. With the use of a toner, one can better prep their pores to absorb skin-beneficial ingredients from moisturizers or serums applied after its use. The Neemli Glycolic Acid & Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner helps clear accumulated dirt and debris through an exfoliating process, clarifying skin and balancing its pH levels. Among the Alpha-Hydroxy Acids or AHAs, glycolic acid has the unique ability to go deeper into the skin, promoting skin cell renewal by effectively exfoliating the upper layers of the skin. A natural astringent, Apple Cider Vinegar helps increase the blood flow to the skin, minimizing the appearance of pores. It also helps balance the skin’s pH to keep it functioning optimally and fighting acne-causing bacteria. This potent mix of ingredients is balanced by the calming properties of aloe vera, making this toner an effective beauty tool to retexturize skin with an added glow. The Neemli Glycolic Acid & Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner is not tested on animals. It is free from animal derived raw materials, sulphates, parabens, petroleum oils and alcohol. Benefits Balancing pH Levels: The combination of ingredients in this toner work to balance your skin’s pH level. This regulates the skin’s oil production and moisture levels, balancing dry, oily or combination skin. Apple cider vinegar works as a natural astringent, balancing the skin’s pH while glycolic acid balances these levels through the day. Improving Overall Skin Appearance: This toner helps in giving your skin a ‘double cleanse’ to clear remnants of makeup, grime and dead skin cells. Apple cider vinegar helps in exfoliating the skin, smoothing out and improving skin texture while absorbing excess oil. With its skin-renewing properties, glycolic acid helps smooth fine wrinkles, improving skin tone. It also helps plump the skin while boosting hydration levels. Fighting Acne & Scars: Glycolic acid helps clear out pores preventing blockages, blackheads and inflammed breakouts. The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar has antibacterial properties that help destroy the bacteria that cause acne. Its exfoliating properties also take off the layers of dead skin, reducing the appearance of acne scars over time and getting rid of hyperpigmentation. How to Use This toner is ideal for once-a-day use (at night) As part of your daily skincare routine, use this toner as a second step after cleansing After washing face with a gentle cleanser, use a cotton pad with the toner and gently use on face and neck in sweeping circular motions Avoid contact with eyes Do not rinse off Follow up with other products as needed Wake up with smooth, clarified skin Ingredients List Glycolic Acid A type of Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA), glycolic acid effectively works on the upper layers of the skin to strip away dead skin cells. It also encourages skin to retain moisture, delivering hydration benefits. An ideal ingredient when treating hyperpigmentation, glycolic acid helps in reversing effects of sun damage. With its small molecular size, it penetrates skin easily, removing excess skin cells and making pores appear smaller. With its dual exfoliating and hydration properties, it provides better skin texture, brighter skin and reduced dark spots and wrinkles. Apple Cider Vinegar Derived from apples through a fermentation process, apple cider vinegar or ACV has a naturally acidic pH that can help balance the pH levels of your skin, keeping it functioning optimally. Rich in malic acid, ACV gently exfoliates and unclogs pores, working well on acne-prone skin and reducing dark spots and hyperpigmentation.

Hydrated skin is healthy skin and nothing can do it better than the Neemli Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer. With its lightweight texture and fast-absorbing formula, this moisturizer is non-comedogenic and helps control oil production, leaving your skin well balanced, hydrated, plump and youthful. MRP: Rs. 425 10ml 50ml ₹ 425 ₹ 255 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works DON’T WAIT - HYDRATE! Sometimes, the loss of moisture can increase oil production in the skin leading to shiny, clogged skin. External aggressors including pollution and UV rays can damage the skin’s moisture barrier causing moisture to escape and irritants to enter leading to dryness, itchiness, breakouts and fine lines. In this case, using the right moisturizer will help repair the damaged moisture barrier, improving skin hydration without clogging pores. Hyaluronic acid acts as a sponge, pulling water from the environment into the skin and repairing the skin’s barrier. This helps in softening fine lines and making skin look firmer while smoothing out dry, rough patches. Hyaluronic acid also plumps and adds volume to skin cells, giving it a more radiant appearance. Oat amino acids have pH balancing properties that add moisture and sooth the skin, while protecting against the detrimental effects of environmental exposure. Together with soothing aloe vera and antioxidant rich Niacinamide, this moisturizer not only protects from moisture loss, but also guards against chemical and UV damage, balancing oiliness and improving skin resistance. The Neemli Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer is not tested on animals. It is free from animal derived raw materials, sulphates, parabens and artificial fragrance. Benefits Skin Hydration & Moisture Retention : Hyaluronic acid is one of the best hydrating agents, attracting water into the skin. This makes skin moisturized and plumped, reducing fine lines, wrinkles and sagging without any greasiness. Oat Amino Acid, rich in lipids, can easily penetrate the skin and provide enhanced moisturization. When used after a shower, this moisturizer also helps trap and retain moisture in the skin, leaving it feeling soft and supple all day. Maintaining Skin Elasticity : As we age, our skin loses moisture. When you put hyaluronic acid back into the skin, it helps in restoring and replenishing its supply. This leads to improved elasticity and moisturized, firm and supple skin with reduced fine lines and wrinkles. How to Use When used as part of your daily skincare routine, use this moisturizer as a third step after cleansing and toning Take a small amount and use the tips of your fingers to massage onto skin in an upward motion Use daily for best results Ingredients List Aqua,Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice C12 C15 Alkyl ester, Soy Lecithin, Dimethicone, Vetiver Hydrosol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Rose Water, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Oat Amino Acids, Lecithin, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate , Lysolecithin, Niacinamide , 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid , Phenethyl Alcohol , Bisabolol , Caprylhydroxamic Acid , Tocopheryl Acetate, Phytic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate & Pottasium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane Benzophenone-3 & Phospholipids & 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Methyl undeclynate.

A star ingredient from the AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) family, glycolic acid is the holy grail of exfoliation that sloughs away dead skin cells and treats pigmentation from age spots and acne. Coupled with salicylic acid with its ability to go deep and pull out excess dirt and sebum while acting as an inflammatory makes this a mild yet super effective formula to prevent acne and give your skin a visible radiance boost. Enhanced with other anti-microbial, soothing ingredients like taraktogenos kurzii seed oil, magnolia bark extract and witch hazel water, this serum is the best way to gently tackle the acne-prone, oily and slightly troublesome skin. The Neemli Glycolic & Salicylic Serum is not tested on animals. It is free from animal derived raw materials, parabens, propylene glycol and fragrance. Benefits Treating Acne : Salicylic acid has the unique ability to go deep into the skin and pull out excess dirt and sebum. Being naturally anti-inflammatory, it helps to normalize keratinization or the bonding together of dead skin cells, reducing and preventing future acne and breakouts. Unclogging Pores : When dead skin cells mix up with our skin’s natural oil, our pores tend to look bigger and stretched. Glycolic acid helps in exfoliating the top layer of the skin, decreasing the amount of dead skin cells getting trapped inside the pore. On the other hand, being oil-soluble salycylic acid reaches deep inside pores, loosening up clogs and making them appear smaller. Balancing Excessive Oil Production : One of the few ingredients that actually slow down your skin’s oil production, salicylic acid reduces sebum secretion, keeping your natural skin oil in balance while glycolic acid reduces excessive oil production and clogged pores, maintaining smooth and balanced skin. How to Use This serum is best used as a night repair treatment Use 4 – 5 drops of serum on cleansed, toned face and neck Massage it in and leave it on Apply moisturizer and other creams after applying serum Not to be used in the day Ease into the treatment by applying it 2-3 times a week, gradually building to daily use Wake up with smoother, healthier and more resilient skin!

I don't think I need to look out for any other brand now for my skincare when it comes to serums ❤️ T Tapan Jani good and highly recommended I've grappled with acne-prone oily skin for close to 9 years. Despite trying numerous products, including dermatologist recommendations, nothing seemed to make a lasting difference. However, the Niacinamide solution from Neemli Naturals has been a revelation for my skin! I truly feel like I've found a hidden gem. Immensely grateful to Neemli Naturals. Reviewed after 45 days of consistent use. m maitreyi reddy niacinamide was good for oily skin and with makeup use Recently got married and amidst all the wedding stress, this niacinamide bottle was my savior. I genuinely noticed a clearer complexion and fewer blemishes even after having all that makeup on which generally doesn't suit me, it worked really well to soothe my skin S Sakina Ali good for everyday use great product to use for day and night results are good C Chandni Best serum! Already on my third bottle! I've never considered taking care of my skin until I actually did and saw the difference. I only use Neemli products and it's made SUCH a huge difference to my skin. This serum has worked wonders, especially since I have sensitive skin. It's faded my acne marks and also helps soothe and calm my skin. Genuinely love this serum and never going to stop using it :) 1 2 This is just a placeholder image.

Reveals Even-Toned, Brighter-Looking Skin: This potent formula helps to reveal even-toned, brighter-looking skin by inhibiting tyrosinase synthesis and blocking the spread of pigment-producing cells. pH 4 - 5: The concentrate has a pH range of 4 - 5, which is ideal for promoting healthy skin and preventing irritation. Free of Fragrance, Parabens, Essential Oils, and Animal-Derived Raw Materials: This product is free of harsh chemicals and ingredients that can be irritating to the skin, making it suitable for a wide range of skin types. Benefits Melasma :Tranexamic Acid is an effective treatment option for melasma because it targets the underlying cause of the condition, which is the overproduction of melanin. It not only helps to fade existing dark spots but also prevents new spots from forming. Studies have shown that Tranexamic Acid can significantly improve the appearance of melasma, with visible results within just a few weeks of use. Reducing Hyperpigmentation : Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin. This can help reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation, such as dark spots, age spots, and sun damage. Lightening Dark Circles : The 10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate is specifically designed to target dark circles, which can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, aging, and lack of sleep. Tranexamic acid helps to brighten the skin under the eyes, making dark circles less noticeable. Reducing Inflammation : Tranexamic acid has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness, swelling, and irritation on the skin. This makes it an excellent ingredient for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin. Promoting Even Skin Tone : By reducing hyperpigmentation and brightening the skin, the Neemli Naturals 10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate can help promote a more even skin tone. This can lead to a healthier, more youthful-looking complexion. Improving Texture : Tranexamic acid has also been shown to improve the texture of the skin by increasing hydration and promoting collagen production. This can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as improve the overall appearance of the skin.

Free of Fragrance, Parabens, Essential Oils, and Animal-Derived Raw Materials: This product is free of harsh chemicals and ingredients that can be irritating to the skin, making it suitable for a wide range of skin types. Benefits Melasma :Tranexamic Acid is an effective treatment option for melasma because it targets the underlying cause of the condition, which is the overproduction of melanin. It not only helps to fade existing dark spots but also prevents new spots from forming. Studies have shown that Tranexamic Acid can significantly improve the appearance of melasma, with visible results within just a few weeks of use. Reducing Hyperpigmentation : Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin. This can help reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation, such as dark spots, age spots, and sun damage. Lightening Dark Circles : The 10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate is specifically designed to target dark circles, which can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, aging, and lack of sleep. Tranexamic acid helps to brighten the skin under the eyes, making dark circles less noticeable. Reducing Inflammation : Tranexamic acid has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness, swelling, and irritation on the skin. This makes it an excellent ingredient for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin. Promoting Even Skin Tone : By reducing hyperpigmentation and brightening the skin, the Neemli Naturals 10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate can help promote a more even skin tone. This can lead to a healthier, more youthful-looking complexion. Improving Texture : Tranexamic acid has also been shown to improve the texture of the skin by increasing hydration and promoting collagen production. This can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as improve the overall appearance of the skin.

Despite trying numerous products, including dermatologist recommendations, nothing seemed to make a lasting difference. However, the Niacinamide solution from Neemli Naturals has been a revelation for my skin! I truly feel like I've found a hidden gem. Immensely grateful to Neemli Naturals. Reviewed after 45 days of consistent use. m maitreyi reddy niacinamide was good for oily skin and with makeup use Recently got married and amidst all the wedding stress, this niacinamide bottle was my savior. I genuinely noticed a clearer complexion and fewer blemishes even after having all that makeup on which generally doesn't suit me, it worked really well to soothe my skin S Sakina Ali good for everyday use great product to use for day and night results are good R Rutuja Must have for textured skin. This product works great if you are having textured skin. I used to have a lot of texture on my forehead but after using this Niacinamide serum, I started noticing a huge difference. There is still a little texture left, with continued use of this serum, I am certain I can get rid of it. Also, this serum sinks into the skin unlike some other niacinamide serums out in the market. 1 2 This is just a placeholder image.

Peptide Powerhouse: Enhanced with peptides, the serum acts as a \"collagen booster\", fortifying skin's elasticity and combating signs of aging from deep within. Fast-Absorbing Formula: This \"lightweight retinol serum\" seamlessly integrates into any skincare routine, ensuring rapid absorption without any residue. Nightly Renewal Ritual: Ideally used during nighttime, it works to rejuvenate the skin as you sleep, solidifying its place as an \"essential night serum\" for skin regeneration. Neemli's Blend of Innovation and Nature: Combining modern science with organic ingredients, this \"natural peptide serum\" guarantees effective results with gentle care. Benefits Visibly Reducing Signs Of Aging : A derivative of Vitamin A, Retinol helps alter the behavior of skin cells, refining and smoothening skin texture and enhancing radiance. It stimulates collagen production, accelerating skin renewal and reducing the effects of aging while targeting uneven skin texture and age spots. Infused with peptide complex, this serum also helps firm and lift skin, giving it a plump, restored look. Firming And Lifting Skin : Peptides, or the blocks that make up protein, easily penetrate the skin and signal it to repair itself, which leads to a boost of collagen production. Consistent use of this effective serum leads to increased elasticity making skin firm, smooth and plump. Combating Hyperpigmentation : One of the most important benefits of retinol is its ability to increase cell turnover. This serum provides a fastened renewal effect, which means that over time, pigmented cells get replaced with new skin cells, combating different forms of hyperpigmentation including sun spots and age spots as well as fine lines and wrinkles. Combined with peptides, this serum helps boost overall collagen production, reducing the appearance of pores and dark patches while brightening skin. Brightening And Acne Control : This serum enriched with retinol, exfoliates at a cellular level, brightening dull skin and revealing smooth, healthy skin. It also stops pores from clogging, controlling acne and normalizing cell turnover. Hyaluronic Acid provides long-lasting hydration and Niacinamide or Vitamin B3 helps your skin grow a ceramide barrier, which evens out skin tone, giving you a balanced complexion. How to Use This serum is best used as a night repair treatment Use 2 – 4 drops of serum on cleansed, toned face and neck Massage it in and leave it on Apply moisturizer and other creams after applying serum Ease into the treatment by applying it 3-4 times a week, gradually building to daily use Wake up with tighter, brighter skin! *Caution: It is advised not to be used during pregnancy Ingredients List DM Water, Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate Encapsulated, Glyceryl sterate citrate, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate, Lysolecithin , Niacinamide , 3-O- Ethyl Ascorbic Acid , Phenethyl Alcohol , Bisabolol , Caprylhydroxamic Acid , Tocopheryl Acetate , Phytic Acid , Caprylyl Glycol, Oat Amino Acid, Hexanoyl Dipeptide-3 Norleucine Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, SorbitolHyaluronic Acid, (Myrciaria dubia)Camu Camu extract,Lysolecithin , Sclerotium Gum , Xanthan Gum , Pullulan,Allantoin, Sea Plankthon water,Licorice Extract,Oryza Sative(Rice) Water,Sodium levullinate and pottasium sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice, Essential Oils Blend.

I know retinol takes months to show it's effects thus I'm writing this after months of using this serum. I enjoy this serum, however I don't think they amount or potency of the ingredients in the bottle are as strong as I'd prefer. I find glycolic acid gives me a better glow than this. That being said it's a nice light weight serum that feels soothing on the skin. I have very sensitive skin and it's never irritated my skin. After a year of use, I haven't seen enough of a difference in my skin to continue using it though. S Snigdha Das Very nice product N Neha worked wonders for 40 plus I had been looking for a serum to help me with my wisdom skin. I am 44 years old. I recently started an Instagram account and it was filled with at least 20-30 good products, all claiming to be the best leaving me ina dilemma to choose. I researched the ingredients and their % that would suit me and are required by my skin; Retinol being one of them, Vitamin C being another. I have tried a lot of other products and I had reached a point where I didn't want to invest any more money on experimenting. Then I came across an ad for Neemli and I liked the fact they didn't use a 20-year-old to publicize an aging skin care product. And to top it all there was a discount *wink wink* i took a chance and ordered my first Neemli product. I have to say I am not at all disappointed. The results were amazing. As compared to other creams and serums I have used in the past- No break outs, it doesn't hurt the eyes, it gets absorbed in skin, not greasy, no residue. My skin feels like a baby's bottom. I have just started using it, will come back for more results. If the discount comes back I am being another one for backup. R Rebecca D be consistent Finally got myself to write a review for this serum which I have grown quite accustomed to now having being using it since a year, it took a month and a half to notice changes in my skin which was having multiple issues at the time but I stuck to it and bought a second bottle as well and now I cant do without it, I think this is my 8th bottle so yes this ones highly recommended 1 2 3 This is just a placeholder image.

Our Glycolic & Salicylic Serum is a multi-functional superstar that doesn’t just control bacteria and clear dead skin cells, but also soothes with minimal irritation to sensitive skin with its unique botanical formula. With exfoliating glycolic acid and dirt-destroying salycylic acid, this serum works synergistically to alleviate clogged pores, blackheads and acne giving you clearer, brighter and more radiant skin. MRP: Rs. 1,099 5ml 15ml 30ml ₹ 1,099 ₹ 659 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works The Neemli Glycolic & Salicylic Acid Serum is an effective formula that refreshes the skin and keeps breakouts at bay. The serum contains glycolic acid, which sloughs away dead skin cells and treats pigmentation, and salicylic acid, which pulls out excess dirt and sebum. The formula is enhanced with other anti-microbial, soothing ingredients like taraktogenos kurzii seed oil, magnolia bark extract and witch hazel water. The serum is gentle and effective for acne-prone, oily, and troublesome skin. The product is not tested on animals and is free from animal-derived raw materials, parabens, propylene glycol, and fragrance. Benefits Treating Acne : Salicylic acid has the unique ability to go deep into the skin and pull out excess dirt and sebum. Being naturally anti-inflammatory, it helps to normalize keratinization or the bonding together of dead skin cells, reducing future acne and breakouts. Unclogging Pores : When dead skin cells mix up with our skin’s natural oil, our pores tend to look bigger and stretched. Glycolic acid helps in exfoliating the top layer of the skin, decreasing the amount of dead skin cells getting trapped inside the pore. On the other hand, being oil-soluble salycylic acid reaches deep inside pores, loosening up clogs and making them appear smaller. Balancing Excessive Oil Production : One of the few ingredients that actually slow down your skin’s oil production, salicylic acid reduces sebum secretion, keeping your natural skin oil in balance while glycolic acid reduces excessive oil production and clogged pores, maintaining smooth and balanced skin. How to Use This serum is best used as a night repair treatment Use 2 – 3 drops of serum on cleansed, toned face and neck Massage it in and leave it on Apply moisturizer and other creams after applying serum Not to be used in the day. Ease into the treatment by applying it 3-4 times a week, gradually building to daily use Wake up with smoother, healthier and more resilient skin!

It burnt a bit. Then stung. And I had to take it off quickly N Nitasha Chandran Excellent This mask was a worthwhile buy- though it has clay, it doesn't dry out my mature skin. Gentle to use! N Nandini Not a great experience I have been using neemli - moisturiser and sunscreen for quite some time and it suits my acne prone skin . Recently got the mask which didnâ€™t suit me at all incase after the patch test , applied it on my face and it turned red after I washed it off. Had to apply lots of aloe gel and ice to calm my skin. There is some ingredient which is too strong . I think this product isnâ€™t for me :( This is just a placeholder image.

MRP: Rs. 2,450 ₹ 2,450 ₹ 1,470 Copy link Share Subcribe to back in stock notification Why It Works Benefits How to Use Ingredients List Customer Reviews Why It Works Tea Tree and Salicylic Face Wash : Let’s face it – different faces, different face washes. If you have oily, combination and acne prone skin our Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash is for you. Combining the strong antibacterial properties of tea tree oil with the anti-inflammatory superstar salicylic acid, this natural face wash calms and sanitizes skin, treating flare-ups without drying out the skin. It leaves skin feeling clean, fresh and ready to take on the day Glycolic & Salicylic Serum: When it comes to acne and troubled skin, it takes two things to deal with to really deal with it – consistency and great products that are right for you. Our Glycolic & Salicylic Serum is a multi-functional superstar that doesn’t just control bacteria and clear dead skin cells but also soothes with minimal irritation to sensitive skin with its unique botanical formula. With exfoliating glycolic acid and dirt-destroying salicylic acid, this serum works synergistically to alleviate clogged pores, blackheads and acne giving you clearer, brighter and more radiant skin. Glycolic and Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner: Toners have come a long way and so have you! The perfect quick hit of hydration and clarification, toners bring your skin back to its natural acidic state, ready to absorb the goodness of other skin products. With gently exfoliating glycolic acid and pH balancing apple cider vinegar, the Neemli Exfoliating Toner is a potent clarifying agent that deeply cleans pores and sweeps away excess oil to give you a smoother, brighter and more radiant look. Benefits Treating Acne : Salicylic acid has the unique ability to go deep into the skin and pull out excess dirt and sebum. Being naturally anti-inflammatory, it helps to normalize keratinization or the bonding together of dead skin cells, reducing future acne and breakouts. Unclogging Pores : When dead skin cells mix up with our skin’s natural oil, our pores tend to look bigger and stretched. Glycolic acid helps in exfoliating the top layer of the skin, decreasing the number of dead skin cells getting trapped inside the pore. On the other hand, oil-soluble salicylic acid reaches deep inside pores, loosening up clogs and making them appear smaller. Balancing Excessive Oil Production : One of the few ingredients that actually slow down your skin’s oil production, salicylic acid reduces sebum secretion, keeping your natural skin oil in balance while glycolic acid reduces excessive oil production and clogged pores, maintaining smooth and balanced skin. How to Use Cleanse your face with the Tea Tree and Salicylic Face Wash Apply the Glycolic and Salicylic Serum during the night Spray on the Glycolic and Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner 1 to 2 times in a day Use the Tea Tree and Salicylic Face Wash twice a day Ingredients List Refer to each of the product pages.

This lotion meets the criteria perfectly. I love the pleasing smell. I usually moisturise twice a day but it's not really needed as using the lotion once also is moisturising enough for the entire day. This is just a placeholder image.

I rarely write reviews...the only small downside of this product is that it makes my nose oily a few hrs after the application...this might be the only one facing this issue...cause skin products react differently to different skin types and people keeping these little things aside....to the one, who made this beautiful product, take a bow...i was waiting since sometime for 50spf...KINDLY NEVER DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT....my intention in writing this review is to ask you for making this product forever.. Such an easy way to apply sunscreen...this product makes me want to use sunscreen and its re-application...the best way to re-apply sunscreen so hygienically where ever you are.... <3 S Shivangani Really nice sunscreen True to its claim, the sunscreen is lightweight and does not leave a white cast. I have dry skin so I like that the product is not drying. However, it doesn't give a matte-finish. Overall, I am really likinng the product. S Sona Ramesha Very niceeee Very nice and effective , Kudos to team Neemli N Naina ghoshal pathetic packaging My sunscreen came leaked please resolve the matter urgently s shikha dhanuka best for anti ageing I don't if this counts as a review but sunscreen is the best step for not ageing your skin and one was so good to use i really feel like mentioning that as it's so important 1 2 3 This is just a placeholder image.

Yes, our natural SPF 30 mattifying sunscreen is vegan and cruelty-free. We do not use any animal-derived ingredients or test on animals. What is a natural sunscreen?

How often should I reapply this sunscreen? We recommend reapplying sunscreen every two hours or immediately after swimming or sweating to maintain optimal sun protection. Can I use this sunscreen under makeup? Yes, our natural SPF 30 mattifying sunscreen is lightweight and non-greasy, making it an excellent base for makeup application. We recommend letting the sunscreen fully absorb into the skin before applying makeup. How should I store this sunscreen? We recommend storing our natural SPF 30 mattifying sunscreen in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Is this sunscreen waterproof? Our natural SPF 30 mattifying sunscreen is water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, so it's perfect for outdoor activities like swimming or exercising. Related Products “Filters are great.

It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this: Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like piña coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.) ...or something like this: The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.

At Neemli Natural’s , we make our soaps with the best ingredients we can find... it's not always cheap but it does make a difference. So our base oils are literally good enough to eat... we specify food-grade oils that cost perhaps twice the price of less-refined grades. And we don't just chuck a couple of base oils and a scent in there... our soaps might mix three or four bases, including shea butter for smoothness and coconut oil for a princely lather. It does make a difference. After all, this is a product you're meant to take home and rub on your body. Our formulation and our execution are also second-to-none. Some handmade soap is dry and crumbly, some is slimy and some is just plain not very nice. We believe bars like this are faulty and wouldn't sell them. That is, of course, assuming that what you're looking at really is 'handmade soap' at all. The easy, cheap and quick way to do a creative soap with an artistic look or an original scent is to buy in a ready-made mass-produced soap base, melt it down, throw in a handful of dried petals and some fragrances or whatever and then come up with an honest-sounding earthy description. That's why you'll see a lot of soap described with words like 'fresh', 'herbal' and 'pure' and 'home-made'... [/apane] [apane title=\"So some freshly-made soap isn't handmade at all? \"] Nope. It's called 'melt-and-pour' or glycerin soap and is made from a commercial base, either supplied as a solid block or as ready-to-melt soap noodles. We won't deny that some people do amazing things with melt-and-pour soap and turn out fancy-looking products in beautiful and expensive packaging; there's a certain artistry to it when done at its best. But it's not the same thing that Neemli Naturals and other traditional soap makers produce. We suggest you always ask a supplier specifically if a soap is handmade from scratch if you're not sure. Check the label too... look for preservatives such as SLS (sodium laurel sulphate) or artificial fragrances. Be wary of bright colours and fabulous fruit smells too... we've tried and tried but we can't find natural ingredients and colourants that give us either of these. [/apane] [apane title=\"Is your soap good for my eczema? \"]We're not allowed to promote our soaps as having curative or medicinal properties unless we actually treat them as medicines and get them tested and certified as such. So the short answer is that we can't comment. But we have had several regular customers who have stated that the soap has helped with skin problems. This may be a side effect of the relatively natural ingredients in our soaps (or indeed in other cold-process soaps)... it may be preservatives, colourants or fragrances in commercial soaps that cause unpleasant reactions. Our best suggestion is that you try our soap for a while and see how it sits with you.[/apane] [apane title=\"And which of your shampoo soaps is best for my dry to middling hair? \"]Sorry... they're all the same. Unlike typical commercial shampoo manufacturers who delight in offering 19 variations of 13 brands for you to choose from, we accept the simple idea that shampoo is shampoo... it grabs hold of the dirt in your hair so that it then washes away when you rinse. If you want scientific-sounding gunk with revolutionary properties and little animated arrows that nourish, shine, revitalize for up to eight hours or just rush around your television screen, there are plenty of suppliers out there. And if you find your hair is squeaky clean and a little hard after washing it properly with a good shampoo soap, rinse it through with a diluted solution of vinegar or lemon juice. Works for us...[/apane] [apane title=\"Does your soap have the natural pH of water? \"]No, it's soap. And soap is, by definition, a somewhat alkaline substance. We could add a bunch of chemicals to it to make it pH7 like water but then it probably wouldn't be soap anymore and we'd have to call it a cleansing bar or something.[/apane] [apane title=\"Why is your soap so expensive? \"]Because of the ingredients we use, how we make it (by hand) and how we wrap it (by hand). In practice, we're not particularly expensive compared to some handmade or fancy factory soaps and we certainly don't charge a premium price just for our name.[/apane] [apane title=\"My family all have sensitive skin, can we safely use Neemli Naturals products?\"]By using natural ingredients we are able to produce beautifully mild soaps and skin care products. Sometimes however, sensitive skin can be unpredictable, so we suggest you do a skin test - use a small amount of product on your skin and leave it for at least 24 hours. You will then be able to assess your sensitivity before using the product further. It is worth remembering that some people are allergic to natural products too. [/apane] [apane title=\"Does Neemli Naturals make all Neemli products?\"] Yes, we enjoy developing, testing and making all our own natural products - by hand - here in Karjat. Our aim is to help reduce the unnecessary amount of man-made chemicals and synthetics people are (usually unknowingly) using on their skin. [/apane] [apane title=\"How do you guarantee product quality?\"] We always purchase the finest oils, butters, waxes and botanicals from our supplier which is also a family run business with an excellent reputation. All Neemli Naturals products are produced by hand in small batches in order to ensure the highest quality for our customers. We maintain batch records for everything we make - this gives us the ability to trace the source of the ingredients in any particular batch should we need to. We take pride and pleasure in delivering the very best products to our family, friends, neighbors and customers. [/apane] [apane title=\"Do you test on animals?\"] No, we do not test our products on animals, nor do we commission anyone else to do that on our behalf. However we do test on ourselves and willing family and friends. [/apane] [apane title=\"I'm new to Neemli Naturals products, do you provide samples?\"] F ortunately we are now able to provide samples of our products, we do so with our regular customers. [/apane] [apane title=\"Where can I buy Neemli Naturals Products?\"] Either from this website or directly from the Neemli Naturals HQ Neem Bada Kothimbe. We are slowly building a network of retail stockists; if you would like to know if there is somewhere local to you then please call us on 9819602121. We also sell our products at local fleas and fairs - do come along and say 'hello', we'd love to meet you!. Please Contact Us if you would like to find out more, or follow us on Facebook & Instagram for updates. [/apane] [apane title=\"What's the best way to look after my Neemli Naturals soap?\"] We cure our soaps for at least 6 weeks before we sell them, so they are hard and mild enough to use. It is important to remember that natural soap contains no harsh chemicals or preservatives, so we recommend that you allow it to dry between uses - ideally by using a soap dish that allows excess water to drain or by standing the bar on its end so that air can circulate around it. Natural soap loves to breathe! To enjoy a long-lasting bar of soap don’t let it get soggy … so don’t leave it submerged in water for too long, and try to keep it away from a shower spray. Keep it well-drained (allow it to dry) between uses - ideally by using a ridged or self-draining soap dish - or leave it to stand on its end so that air can circulate around it. [/apane] [apane title=\"Does my Neemli Naturals soap have a 'use by' date?\"] No, our soap is made using the cold process method and matures with age. Even when kept for a couple of years it will be beautifully mild and a pleasure to use. However, to fully appreciate the natural scent and properties from the essential oils that we use in every bar, we recommend that you enjoy your soap within 6-12 months of purchase. [/apane] [apane title=\"I am a Vegan, can I use Neemli Natural’s products?\"] We do not use animal fat in any of our products.Most of our products are vegan except in some of our skin care products we use honey or beeswax as they have such amazing properties - a complete ingredients list can be found alongside every product in the shop. [/apane] [apane title=\"How do you fragrance and colour your products?\"] We only use pure essential oils in Neemli Naturals products - they have amazing properties that help condition and add scent as well as fabulous therapeutic value to our products. To add colour and texture to our soap and skin care we use only herbs, spices, fruits, botanicals and natural colouring. [/apane] [apane title=\"Which of your soap fragrances are most suitable for men & boys?\"] We have men coming to us for an array of products. Their most popular picks include Activated Charcoal Soap , Beer Soap and products with fresh citrusy fragrances.

It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this: Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like piña coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.) ...or something like this: The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.

For those with normal/combo skin, our French Pink & Multani Clay Bathing Bar is a perfect fit. TONE - Next, using a facial toner/mist helps remove any possible residual left from soap while cleansing, as well as hydrate skin so that it can soak up the ingredients from facial oils + serums (next step).

It is one of the super antioxidants to maintain and achieve beautiful healthy skin and is that one ingredient you must look for on your next shopping trip. But, here’s more. Vitamin C doesn’t only protect our skin from free radical damage, it also plays a crucial role in anti-ageing, acne, wound healing and even hyperpigmentation which we will share in this article. The best way to improve skin health through Vitamin C is by daily intake and, in skincare but, not just anything that’s labelled as vitamin C, instead well formulated products like our Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum(read the article to know why it is different). Think of our skin like a plant, we nourish plants from the inside through organic fertilisers and also protect them from outside through desired sun exposure and regular watering to prevent from damage and drying out. While in the case of our skin, we need to go a little further by adding antioxidant-rich products to protect from UV rays, radiation, pollution, smoke and other external factors. So, let us guide you on why do we need to “eat our vitamin C” and “slather it on our skin” to achieve plump and glowing skin. Benefits Of Vitamin C Through Diet Vitamin C is a naturally occurring water-soluble vitamin also called ascorbic acid. It is majorly found in fruits, vegetables and certain herbs. The consequences of vitamin C deficiency was discovered hundreds of years ago when soldiers developed Scurvy, a disease that shows many severe symptoms such as bleeding of gums, anaemia, impaired wound healing, swelling and extreme weakness. Although Scurvy symptoms aren’t reported anymore in the modern world and developed countries(not that is doesn’t exist anymore), lots of research has been done over the years that has only led to finding out many other roles of vitamin C in our body that also, directly and indirectly, affect how our skin functions, looks and feels. Some of those are; Protecting Cell DNA Stress, smoke and unhealthy diet all lead to cell damage(cell damage= irregular functioning of the skin) which can be reduced through vitamin C. Wound Healing Applies to internal wounds as well as cuts and bruises Reducing Oxidative Damage Important to delay aging and prevent sun spots Strengthening Blood Vessels Help reduce dark circles, post inflammatory erthyma(PIH) Building and Supporting Collagen Needed for skin and joints Tissue Growth Flexibity and wear and tear of the muscles Increasing Efficiency of Sunscreen Further protection from sun tan, sun burn, rough thick skin Absorption of Iron Indirectly helps with dark circles and bruising and paler looking skin Bone Mass Density Important for faster healing of fractures and reduce bone mass loss that occurs with aging leading to changes in the shape of the face. Metabolism of Proteins proteins, including collagen being the most important elements for built and functions, vitamin C has a key role in their synthesis making it extremely valuable for our defense system. Unfortunately, vitamin C is not produced by our body. Yes, our body does not possess the specific enzyme activity required for vitamin C synthesis which leaves us with only one option—daily intake of vitamin C rich foods in moderation(portions matter) such as kiwi, red and yellow bell peppers, guava, papaya, strawberries, mustard spinach(ever heard of sarso ka saag?) and good old OJ aka a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice AND daily topical application of products containing vitamin C. Supplements are a great way to repair damage that’s already been done and strengthen skin tissues, boost immunity during an illness, prevent or reduce the effects of certain diseases and harmful drugs, However, do not tend to supplements as the only way of vitamin C intake as foods also offer other minerals, natural sugars and fibres all of which are required by our body. If you are thinking that eating your vitamin C does so much then why not skip it in skincare? Below mentioned points will instantly boost your interest further in this “do it all ingredient” and it’s important if you want to achieve brighter skin and look younger for longer. Importance Of Vitamin C In Topical Skincare The topmost layer of our skin—epidermis doesn’t have blood vessels so it is hard for vitamin C absorbed from our foods to perform well in that layer of our skin as very little of it can reach there. Vitamin C is found to be concentrated in epidermis but external offenders like UV rays, harsh cleansing products, irritating skincare ingredients and pollution calls upon extensive use of it which causes drop in its levels making the skin vulnerable to damage in the form of skin darkening, wrinkles, uneven texture, hyperpigmentation and even dermatitis along with life-threatening diseases like cancer. Thus, we must concentrate on topical application to maintain adequate levels and preventing skin damage. Why Kitchen Ingredients Don’ t Work All Neemli products are inspired by nature and are plant based so you can find common DIY ingredients such as aloe vera, green tea, olive oil and more but for these ingredients to work much farther than top most layer of the skin(visible to the naked eye) without causing side effects, they have to be formulated in right concentrations, with proper hygiene and combined with other actives so they can perform their very best. Not to mention that many herbs and dried peel powders can actually irritate the skin leading to rashes, redness, swelling and skin darkening. So, next time when you think of vitamin C, please do your skin a favour and skip rubbing lemon slice or smothering your face with orange peel powder. Role Of Vitamin C In Skincare Antioxidant While the skin’s natural lipid(oil) and water content(skin barrier) work as a protective layer, it can not stop UV rays from entering the skin and causing free radicals that lead to cell damage. When we have applied a serum that contains studied form of vitamin C, it neutralises those scavengers before they could start breaking down the skin cells and harm DNA. Delay and Reduce Wrinkles Collagen is one of two very important components of the dermis(second layer of the skin below epidermis) that gives our skin the firmness and defined muscle shape. Due to natural ageing and sun rays, pollution these fibres become weaker, thinner and even start breaking down leading to the commonly called “droopy face”. Vitamin C serums not only protect collagen from external damage but even lead to the formation of new fibres. Thus applying vitamin c serums as a part of acne scar treatment help build collagen in sunken areas that lead to more refined look and smoother skin texture. Fade Dark Spots It has been researched that vitamin C disrupts the activity of tyrosinase—an enzyme that creates melanin(colour of our skin). By doing so, it helps fade dark spots from the sun as well post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation(PIH) which is a result of acne, dermatitis and injuries. Neemli Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serum is specifically created to lighten dark spots and brighten the skin tone. Prevent Lipid Peroxidation Lipids are oils and fats naturally present in our skin. They control the penetration of fluids in the cells(or else we would look a living sponge bob) and protecting the epidermis(top most layer of the skin) from the sun’s rays, exteme weather and strong soap based cleansers. Every cell in our body and obviously in the skin is made up of water and lipid layer surrounding DNA and participating in the transportation of nutrients in and out of the cell. However, lipids are prone to oxidation from long sun exposure. Here’s when the crucial antioxidant role of vitamin C kicks in. It prevents oxidation of lipids thus protecting the skin barrier, cell membrane, DNA and also reducing acne breakouts—according to some valuable research findings relating lipid peroxidation with acne. Amplifying Sun Protection Most of the normal population think of using vitamin C in the day time as a foolish idea. And this myth has been developed and forced into people’s minds because vitamin C has a tendency to oxidise, as in, it will break down in sunlight. But we all know that sunscreen is a must as a part of healthy skincare routine and most vitamin C products have other antioxidants to prevent it from oxidising in the first place. While that myth is all clear now, let is focus on facts. Vitamin C has been proven to fight both sun and pollution related oxidative species and this makes it a wonderful ingredient to add in day time routine. Together with sunscreens, it makes a perfect pair to prevent and repair damage that happens throughout the day. A win win combination! Why Is Neemli Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum Different? Today, we have many varieties of vitamin C layed out in all types of formulas and it is only a matter of minutes before we leave the shopping counter and walk towards a glowing skin. But wait right there! While derivative forms of vitamin C work as antioxidants, not all of them have the potential to penetrate the skin well and fight dark spots. “3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, present in Neemli Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum is a highly stable and penetrable form of vitamin C. It has shown excellent skin brightening benefits in many studies. It converts into ascorbic acid(pure vitamin C) in the skin and due to its smaller molecular size, it can also reach further to help build collagen.” Unlike other brands that focus on vitamin C solely, we have gone a step further by adding 1% pure Hyaluronic Acid that injects the cells with concentrated dose of hydration resulting in plump skin and softer wrinkles. To further amplify the dark spot lightening effects we have used one of most important vitamin derivatives for skin health, Niacinamide or B3. Without the use of silicones or fillers, this serum gives a primer like effect, lightens dark spots, brightens overall skin tone, hydrates, delays ageing all in a Cruelty Free and Vegan formula. Use it alone on oily skin types and can also be coupled with Neemli Argan and Rose Day Cream and Neemli Neemli Hibiscus and Saffron Night Cream for deep nourishment and baby soft skin. Combining the serum with our day and night creams creates a synergistic combination to deliver antioxidants, defy ageing, boost hydration to deeper layers of the skin and prevent transepidermal water loss.

If you have dry, oily, acne-prone or even a combination type of skin, Neemli has you covered with an exciting range of facial care products including serums, toners, moisturizers and sunscreen lotions to keep your skin supple and make you glow! Range of Skincare Products at Neemli Naturals Neemli Naturals offers a wide range of skin care products such as - Facial toners Acid-spot correcting, deep hydration and anti-inflammation concentrates Moisturizers Sunscreen lotions Important Skincare Tips Moisturize twice a day : The best times to moisturize are before you take a shower in the morning and right before you go to bed at night. Neemli’s moisturizers are gentle on the skin and don’t cause irritation. Stay hydrated: Use skin care products with hydrating formulas. Additionally, sip on your water bottle throughout the day to keep yourself feeling hydrated and active. Exfoliate a couple of times each week : We lose millions of skin cells everyday, and if we don’t clear them off our faces, it can make us look dull and sullen. Exfoliating helps remove these dead cells and makes your skin glow. An exfoliator with a neutral pH level should be used to avoid drying out the skin while exfoliation. Don’t touch your face excessively : This can lead to growing germs and dirt deposits on your skin, causing it to scar or break out. This also makes you more susceptible to the flu, and can wrinkle the skin too. Avoid direct heat exposure : Intense heat can cause inflammation and lead the collagen in your skin to break down. Therefore, avoid staying under the sun directly, but if it is unavoidable, use Neemli’s sunscreen to protect your self effectively! A Quick Guide To Choose The Right Skincare Products Choose products according to your skin type : You can only select the best skincare product if you know what your skin type is, such as normal, oily, dry, acne prone and so on. Check the ingredients: Carefully read all the ingredients mentioned in the label on the product. Usually, ingredients are listed in the descending order of their concentrations. Most often, the top five ingredients make up majority of the product, and must be focused on more. Ensure that they are compatible with your skin type to have the best effect. Expiration date : Ensure to check the expiry date of the product before using it as expired products can have little to no effect on your skin or can even make it worse. The patch test : When you are buy products from a store, test the product on a small patch of your skin before making any purchase decision. If you feel some kind of burning or irritation withing minutes of applying it, the product is not for you. FAQs What is the best care for skin? The best way to take care of your skin is by applying moisturizer twice a day, wearing sunscreen when you’re out in the heat, and exfoliating on a regular weekly basis. Drinking ample amounts of water and washing your face regularly as well, will ensure that you skin glows and remains healthy. What are the 5 basics of skincare? Moisturize twice a day, once in the morning and once before bedtime. Use skin care products with hydrating formulas and drink ample amounts of water throughout the day. Exfoliate two to three times a week. Curate and follow a skincare routine consistently. Avoid direct heat exposure as it can cause inflammation and lead the collagen in your skin to break down. What drinks make your skin glow? These drinks, which work best when consumed in the morning, can help your skin glow for the rest of the day - Lemon water and honey Freshly made orange juice Freshly made cucumber juice Coconut water Green tea Milk with turmeric What are the 10 steps of skincare? The ultimate 10 step guide inspired by the Korean 10-step skincare routine is as follows - Oil cleanser Foaming cleanser Exfoliant Toner Essence Serum Sheet mask Eye cream Moisturizer Sun screen (for the day) or night cream (before going to bed) Using these products in this order would ensure that you have perfectly healthy and rejuvenated skin everyday. What does healthy skin look like? When you have healthy skin, you normally won’t feel any swelling, redness or irritation. There would be no acne breakouts or scarring, with irregular dark patches. Your skin feels smooth and there are no rough patches either. What do I eat for glowing skin? Tomatoes, broccoli, avocados, bell peppers, sweet potatoes, walnuts and fatty fish are some examples of food that can help your skin remain healthy and glow. Which vitamins are good for the skin? Vitamin C (which can help improve dry skin and reduce wrinkles), Vitamin D (which can help improve skin tone), Vitamin E (an antioxidant that can help protect from sun damage) and Vitamin K (which can help treat stretch marks and scars) are among the most important vitamins for the skin. How can I glow-up? Curate a skincare routine suitable to your skintype and schedule, and make sure to consistently follow it. Apart from a dedicated routine, eat healthy, balanced diets rich in vitamins and fibers, and drink ample amounts of water. Additionally, exercise regularly and get 6 to 8 hours of sleep daily, so ensure that your skin remains healthy, supple and keeps glowing.

Benefits of using Serums Smoothens the surface of skin Reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines Helps in moisture retention Minimizes the appearance of pores Refines skin’s texture Minimizes signs of fatigue Choosing the right serum for your face type There are two important factors to consider when you are choosing the right serum - What concern are you combating? Is it fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots or acne? Based on the issue, choose a serum that claims to alleviate exactly that problem. Also consider your skin type before choosing a serum.

Choosing the right serum according to your Skin Concern If you concerned with fine lines and wrinkles, look for serums with retinol, which can boost skin turnover and stimulate collagen production. If you have sensitive skin and want to smoother fine lines and wrinkles, go for serums with Bakuchiol - a retinol alternative, but unlike retinol, it does not cause redness, burns or itching. It is a lot more gentle on the skin. For hydrating combination or oily skin, use serums that contain hyaluronic acid because it can hold thousand times its weight in water, and it completely lightweight. To prevent breakouts and pores, serums with salisylic acids are the best as they can decongest pores with relative ease. To lift sagging skin, serums with peptides are the best as they add support to lax skin by stimulating collagen and elastin production, which can reduce wrinkles and sag.

It brightens and plumps skin tissue... ₹ 3,750 ₹ 2,250 Add to cart Sunscreens Sunscreens are absolutely necessary to protect your skin from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Sunscreen protects against sunburn and can help prevent skin cancer as well. With rising temperatures today, sunscreens are a must have and at Neemli Naturals, sunscreens suitable for all skin are available, so hurry now! Benefits of applying Sunscreen Protection from sunburn - Sunscreen protects the skin from exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which could otherwise cause painful burns. Repeated sunburn can cause skin damage and increase the risk of developing skin cancer as well. Sunburn takes a long time to heal and hence, it is always critical to wear sunscreen even on cooler, cloudy days. Prevents premature aging - Sunscreen can protect your skin from damaging the collagen and connective tissues which often lead to wrinkles. Minimize sun spots - Suncreen combats sun spots that are often the result of exposure to UV rays. Sunspots occur due to hyperpigmentation and can appear on the face, shoulders, arms, back and so on. Enhances the health of skin - Essential skin proteins such as keratin, collagen, elastin, are protected by sunscreen. These proteins in turn, keep the skin smooth and healthy. How to choose Sunscreen for your Skin Check the SPF (Sun Protection Factor) - SPF is the measure of the amount of UV rays the suncreen can filter out. Using SPF of atleast 15 can protect you from daily UV rays exposure. Higher the SPF, greater the level of protection. Consider active ingredients - Check for the active ingredients. Those which include titanium dioxide or zinc oxide are usually very good for the skin. Broad spectrum SPF : Choose sunscreen with a broad spectrum coverage such as SPF between 30 and 50 as it can help protect the skin better from any kind of damage. Type of sunscreen - Choose sunscreen that feels light and soft on the skin. Neemli Naturals’ Mattifying sunscreen uses a water-resistant formula and is super-lightweight, making you feel refreshed while wearing it. Top Products Price List (we will insert this programmatically) FAQs Is sunscreen good for skin? Yes, sunscreen is very good for the skin as it can protect it from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun which causes sunburn and sometimes even skin cancer. Does sunscreen brighten skin? No. Scientifically speaking, sunscreen does not brighten as it doesn’t contain any bleaching agents that could brighten your skin. However, it does prevent sun spots and dark patches, which can help you skin look better and smoother, thereby giving it a gentle glow. Can we apply sunscreen directly on face? Yes, sunscreen should be applied directly on the face for maximum protection. How do you apply sunscreen? Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before you step under the sun for maximum benefit. Take an ounce on your finger and apply it generously on all those parts that are exposed to the sun such as your face, ears and neck. If you are applying sunscreen for your whole body, take a handful, and applying rigourously on all parts of your body that is not already covered, and is open to sunlight. What is a safe sunscreen to use? Sunscreens with SPF of atleast 15 can protect you from daily UV rays exposure. Higher the SPF, greater the level of protection. Is sunscreen necessary for Indian skin? Sunscreen is necessary for all types of skin, as it blocks out the UVA and UVB rays and protects the skin from getting dark spots, blemishes, sunburns and even minimizes the risk of skin cancer. Which sunscreen is best for normal skin? Neemli Naturals’s Mattifying Sunscreen is suitable for all skin types, which includes normal skin. It provides broad spectrum protection, controls oil production and is safe for daily use. Which SPF is best for Indian Skin? For Indian skin, SPF above 15 is ideal. SPF above 50 however, is not necessary as it is just more expensive but the difference between SPF from 15 - 50 and SPF 50+ is negligible. Do you need sunscreen when going to Goa? Sunscreen is a must if you intend on roaming around in Goa, not only during peak hours, but also when it is cooler. This is ensure that you have a good time in the city without getting burnt, or getting dark spots that are difficult to get rid of.

It is one of the super antioxidants to maintain and achieve beautiful healthy skin and is that one ingredient you must look for on your next shopping trip. But, here’s more. Vitamin C doesn’t only protect our skin from free radical damage, it also plays a crucial role in anti-ageing, acne, wound healing and even hyperpigmentation which we will share in this article. The best way to improve skin health through Vitamin C is by daily intake and, in skincare but, not just anything that’s labelled as vitamin C, instead well formulated products like our Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum(read the article to know why it is different). Think of our skin like a plant, we nourish plants from the inside through organic fertilisers and also protect them from outside through desired sun exposure and regular watering to prevent from damage and drying out. While in the case of our skin, we need to go a little further by adding antioxidant-rich products to protect from UV rays, radiation, pollution, smoke and other external factors. So, let us guide you on why do we need to “eat our vitamin C” and “slather it on our skin” to achieve plump and glowing skin. Benefits Of Vitamin C Through Diet Vitamin C is a naturally occurring water-soluble vitamin also called ascorbic acid. It is majorly found in fruits, vegetables and certain herbs. The consequences of vitamin C deficiency was discovered hundreds of years ago when soldiers developed Scurvy, a disease that shows many severe symptoms such as bleeding of gums, anaemia, impaired wound healing, swelling and extreme weakness. Although Scurvy symptoms aren’t reported anymore in the modern world and developed countries(not that is doesn’t exist anymore), lots of research has been done over the years that has only led to finding out many other roles of vitamin C in our body that also, directly and indirectly, affect how our skin functions, looks and feels. Some of those are; Protecting Cell DNA- Stress, smoke and unhealthy diet all lead to cell damage(cell damage= irregular functioning of the skin) which can be reduced through vitamin C. Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Seru m Shop Now Wound Healing- applies to internal wounds as well as cuts and bruises Reducing Oxidative Damage - important to delay aging and prevent sun spots Strengthening Blood Vessels - help reduce dark circles, post inflammatory erthyma(PIH) Building and Supporting Collagen - needed for skin and joints Tissue Growth - flexibity and wear and tear of the muscles Increasing Efficiency of Sunscreen - further protection from sun tan, sun burn, rough thick skin Absorption of Iron - indirectly helps with dark circles and bruising and paler looking skin Bone Mass Density - important for faster healing of fractures and reduce bone mass loss that occurs with aging leading to changes in the shape of the face. Metabolism of Proteins - proteins, including collagen being the most important elements for built and functions, vitamin C has a key role in their synthesis making it extremely valuable for our defense system. Unfortunately, vitamin C is not produced by our body. Yes, our body does not possess the specific enzyme activity required for vitamin C synthesis which leaves us with only one option—daily intake of vitamin C rich foods in moderation(portions matter) such as kiwi, red and yellow bell peppers, guava, papaya, strawberries, mustard spinach(ever heard of sarso ka saag?) and good old OJ aka a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice AND daily topical application of products containing vitamin C. Supplements are a great way to repair damage that’s already been done and strengthen skin tissues, boost immunity during an illness, prevent or reduce the effects of certain diseases and harmful drugs, However, do not tend to supplements as the only way of vitamin C intake as foods also offer other minerals, natural sugars and fibres all of which are required by our body. If you are thinking that eating your vitamin C does so much then why not skip it in skincare? Below mentioned points will instantly boost your interest further in this “do it all ingredient” and it’s important if you want to achieve brighter skin and look younger for longer. Importance Of Vitamin C In Topical Skincare serum droplet The topmost layer of our skin—epidermis doesn’t have blood vessels so it is hard for vitamin C absorbed from our foods to perform well in that layer of our skin as very little of it can reach there. Vitamin C is found to be concentrated in epidermis but external offenders like UV rays, harsh cleansing products, irritating skincare ingredients and pollution calls upon extensive use of it which causes drop in its levels making the skin vulnerable to damage in the form of skin darkening, wrinkles, uneven texture, hyperpigmentation and even dermatitis along with life-threatening diseases like cancer. Thus, we must concentrate on topical application to maintain adequate levels and preventing skin damage. Why Kitchen Ingredients Don’t Work All Neemli products are inspired by nature and are plant based so you can find common DIY ingredients such as aloe vera, green tea, olive oil and more but for these ingredients to work much farther than top most layer of the skin(visible to the naked eye) without causing side effects, they have to be formulated in right concentrations, with proper hygiene and combined with other actives so they can perform their very best. Not to mention that many herbs and dried peel powders can actually irritate the skin leading to rashes, redness, swelling and skin darkening. So, next time when you think of vitamin C, please do your skin a favour and skip rubbing lemon slice or smothering your face with orange peel powder. Role Of Vitamin C In Skincare Antioxidant - While the skin’s natural lipid(oil) and water content(skin barrier) work as a protective layer, it can not stop UV rays from entering the skin and causing free radicals that lead to cell damage. When we have applied a serum that contains studied form of vitamin C, it neutralizes those scavengers before they could start breaking down the skin cells and harm DNA. Delay and Reduce Wrinkles - Collagen is one of two very important components of the dermis(second layer of the skin below epidermis) that gives our skin the firmness and defined muscle shape. Due to natural ageing and sun rays, pollution these fibres become weaker, thinner and even start breaking down leading to the commonly called “droopy face”. Vitamin C serums not only protect collagen from external damage but even lead to the formation of new fibres. Thus applying vitamin c serums as a part of acne scar treatment help build collagen in sunken areas that lead to more refined look and smoother skin texture. Fade Dark Spots - It has been researched that vitamin C disrupts the activity of tyrosinase—an enzyme that creates melanin(colour of our skin). By doing so, it helps fade dark spots from the sun as well post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation(PIH) which is a result of acne, dermatitis and injuries. Neemli Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serum is specifically created to lighten dark spots and brighten the skin tone. Prevent Lipid Peroxidation - Lipids are oils and fats naturally present in our skin. They control the penetration of fluids in the cells(or else we would look a living sponge bob) and protecting the epidermis(top most layer of the skin) from the sun’s rays, extreme weather and strong soap based cleansers. Every cell in our body and obviously in the skin is made up of water and lipid layer surrounding DNA and participating in the transportation of nutrients in and out of the cell. However, lipids are prone to oxidation from long sun exposure. Here’s when the crucial antioxidant role of vitamin C kicks in. It prevents oxidation of lipids thus protecting the skin barrier, cell membrane, DNA and also reducing acne breakouts—according to some valuable research findings relating lipid peroxidation with acne. Amplifying Sun Protection - Most of the normal population think of using vitamin C in the day time as a foolish idea. And this myth has been developed and forced into people’s minds because vitamin C has a tendency to oxidise, as in, it will break down in sunlight. But we all know that sunscreen is a must as a part of healthy skincare routine and most vitamin C products have other antioxidants to prevent it from oxidising in the first place. While that myth is all clear now, let is focus on facts. Vitamin C has been proven to fight both sun and pollution related oxidative species and this makes it a wonderful ingredient to add in day time routine. Together with sunscreens, it makes a perfect pair to prevent and repair damage that happens throughout the day. A win win combination! Why Is Neemli Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum Different? Today, we have many varieties of vitamin C layed out in all types of formulas and it is only a matter of minutes before we leave the shopping counter and walk towards a glowing skin. But wait right there! While derivative forms of vitamin C work as antioxidants, not all of them have the potential to penetrate the skin well and fight dark spots. “3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, present in Neemli Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum is a highly stable and penetrable form of vitamin C. It has shown excellent skin brightening benefits in many studies. It converts into ascorbic acid(pure vitamin C) in the skin and due to its smaller molecular size, it can also reach further to help build collagen .” Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Seru m Shop Now Unlike other brands that focus on vitamin C solely, we have gone a step further by adding 2% pure Hyaluronic Acid that injects the cells with concentrated dose of hydration resulting in plump skin and softer wrinkles. To further amplify the dark spot lightening effects we have used one of most important vitamin derivatives for skin health, Niacinamide or B3. Without the use of silicones or fillers, this serum gives a primer like effect, lightens dark spots, brightens overall skin tone, hydrates, delays ageing all in a Cruelty Free and Vegan formula. Use it alone on oily skin types and can also be coupled with Neemli Argan and Rose Day Cream and Neemli Neemli Hibiscus and Saffron Night Cream for deep nourishment and baby soft skin. Combining the serum with our day and night creams creates a synergistic combination to deliver antioxidants, defy ageing, boost hydration to deeper layers of the skin and prevent transepidermal water loss.

More glow, radiance, smoothness and a better texture is something you can expect by exfoliation your skin once in a while. We wash regularly and use beauty or fairness creams and moisturizers, try to use the best available soap and do everything possible. Even after a lot of efforts, our skin is not at its best and glowing as much as you want it for everyone to use a set of standardised beauty products. The nature of the skin varies from person to person. Your skin might be very oily while your friend’s skin may be dry. You cannot use the same beauty products because the nourishment that your friend’s skin might be totally different from yours. This makes it difficult to standardize the beauty Each product you use on your skin must suit your skin. Skincare products vary from one person to another based on the nature of the skin. Dry, oily or combination skin, one of the best things that you can do to give your skin a natural glow is an exfoliation. Though face exfoliation is quite common, this can be done in any part of your body. This can make you look less flawless and also make sure your skin is healthy. What is exfoliation? We need to know what exactly exfoliation is to be able to do it so that we will be able to reap almost all of its benefits. It is the process in which the dead skin cells are sloughed off from the surface of your skin. This will obviously make your skin more lively and hence better. Exfoliation is of many different kinds and two types are most common and well known. Chemical exfoliation , as the name suggests is the use of chemicals on the skin to break down the surface buildup. Usually, chemicals used for this are salicylic acid or enzymes or other similar chemicals that do not harm the skin. The chemicals used are usually very soft and make sure it is very safe. Use of bad chemicals can cause problems like pimples, permanent or temporary marks and so on. Mechanical exfoliation, on the other hand, is physically scrubbing off your skin’s surface using a scrub or other exfoliating skincare tools. This includes scrubs which can be used to rub the dead cells of your skin, which is usually on the top layer. As there is good knowledge about exfoliation these days, people are trying out new products and scrubs. Of all, the best products that are presently attracting beauty pageants are natural products or scrubs. you can find organic scrubs in many places. These scrubs have no chemicals and are made of extracted oil. This makes it very safe. It is better than using a scrub with chemicals. Why do we have to exfoliate? As we know, when you grow older, the regeneration of the cells becomes slow and the same happens with the skin cells too. When it takes time for your body to generate new cells, there are old cells piling up on the surface of your skin. This can make your skin look extremely dull, dry and sometimes less charming. It can also lead to the formation of acne. Also, as there are dead cells on the top, they can block the pores on the skin. Hence, none of your skin products or your cleansers will be able to help you clean properly. This makes your skin rough and oily. Sometimes, even skin specialists advise exfoliation to make your skin lively. In that case, they will help you out on how to go about it. They will also tell you how often it should be done. When you exfoliate properly, the clogging is removed and hence the skin is more open to make sure the moisturizing products penetrate into your skin. If you are regularly exfoliating the products you use turn out to have an effect and your skin is healthier and much fresher than before. What are the benefits of exfoliating? Improvement of skin texture: Exfoliating your skin speeds up the skin renewal process. Your skin will become shinier and softer. The complexion also becomes soft and glowing. On the whole, exfoliating will give a better texture for your skin. Slower ageing: As you become old, there are changes in your skin due to the slowing down of the cell rejuvenation process and that is why you start getting wrinkles and start looking old. Exfoliating can slow down the process on your skin. Makes your skin tone more consistent: Some people have dark spots and rough textures and it is frustrating to get it treated. Exfoliating properly and on a regular basis can smoothen the skin and make it better. Over time, the skin starts becoming more uniform and starts looking more radiant. Other than this, it can help better circulation, prevents acne, helps skincare products penetrate into the skin and a lot more. There are many benefits but remember that this keeps your skin healthy. The don’ts while exfoliating: Never exfoliate on a wound, an irritated or allergic area or the area that has just been waxed. If you have waxed, you need to wait for at least 24 hours. After you exfoliate, make sure you avoid sources of heat touching your skin. Avoid hot tubs or taking showers in hot water. When you are exfoliating places where the skin is thin, be very careful. The skin in the upper chest, for example, is very thin just like the skin on your face. Be very soft when you exfoliate there. Steps for exfoliating: Use a good quality bristled brush with a long handle. It is better if you start with your legs and move upwards. Brush in a circular motion in a small area as you move up. Once you reach your shoulder, brush your back and arms. Buy a loofah or a glove. There are gloves that are designed for exfoliating. You can use this too. Use a good scrub that has fewer chemicals. It is better if you can buy an organic scrub which has no chemicals. If you use a scrub or a loofah, shower and let the water run through the skin. Remember that you must not use hot water. In case you have a sensitive skin Use a cleanser that is mild on your skin and does not cause any harm. Try it on a small area, preferably your hand or leg and check it before using it on the entire body. Apply a good moisturizer after exfoliating. Make sure the products you use are the ones your skin is used to. Other important tips: The best thing to do is to use products that you are already using. Using products that are new and do not suit your skin can have negative effects. Make sure the method you use is perfect for your skin type, be it chemical or mechanical. Mechanical may be too irritating for you, then go for chemical or the other way round. It is always better to be on the safer side. For this, you must use scrubs and brushes that are organic. These are completely natural and there are no chances of it causing damage or marks on your skin. Be gentle on your skin. Do not scrub hard or use too much force. Being consistent with a schedule is another way one can find better results over time. Work on the right schedule for you. If you keep to the schedule and do it the right way, the results will be good and your skin will keep getting better. Use a good moisturizer once you are done with the exfoliation process. Remember that when you exfoliate, the pores are open and hence, there are more chances of pollution and dirt getting into these pores, especially soon after exfoliating. Hence, never forget to use a moisturizer. Use one that you are familiar with. Final words: Exfoliation is a process of awakening your skin and it is important to do it. It is even more important to do it right. If you have any problems, contact a skin specialist. Make sure you use safe products and use the safest method for you. Remember the above-mentioned points. Try to get the best results because if you do, you are going to turn, not only beautiful but also with healthy skin and a natural glow. body, care, exfoliation, face, organic, scrub, skin, skincare Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

The best way to avoid acne is to take care of your skin regularly which rarely happens due to a hectic schedule. Depending upon the severity of the condition it can be zipped off using home remedies or vegan/ organic products. Let’s find out the types of acne and how to treat it. What is acne? Acne or skin inflammation is a skin condition that happens when your hair follicles get stopped with oil and dead skin cells. This phenomenon causes whiteheads, zits or pimples, and generally shows up on the face, temple, chest, upper back and bears. Acne is most common among teenagers but it can affect adults too given the pollution. Types Of Acne Regular Acne Cystic Acne Regular Acne Regular acne is a state of the skin that appears as changed kinds of knocks. These knocks can be zits, whiteheads, pimples, or growths. Adolescents get skin break out in view of the hormonal changes due to puberty. Pores become obstructed if there is an excessive amount of dead skin cells. Cystic Acne Cystic acne is the most serious type of acne. It can happen anywhere on the face or body. With cystic acne you relatively face more skin inflammation, acne burst out and pain.

How to use Face Serum There's a lot of misinformation on the web when it comes to the ideal way of using skincare products. On top of that Serums are a fairly recent addition to the skincare landscape subjecting them to a lot of misconception. Mainly on the topic of how to use face serum.

Aside from being profoundly supporting and remedial, facial oils can give your skin a uber portion of hydration. The thing to recollect is that you can't utilize pretty much any regular oil as a face oil. It's prescribed that you utilize an oil with a littler sub-atomic size, (for example, argan oil or jojoba oil) to prevent blocking of the pores and allow simple ingestion. What Face Oils Do They provide long-lasting moisturization. They form a seal to help retain the hydration of the skin. It provides vitamins to the skin. Moisturizers Moisturizers are infused with a mix of water and oils and they're intended to hydrate the highest layers of the skin leaving the skin soft and supple.

First of all start with a cleanser, a toner, then the magical elixir oil, follow up by serum, and after that sheet mask, then face oil, and seal in the moisture with a moisturizer. For better and effective results use a face scrub and mask once a week. elixir oil, essential oils, exfoliation, face oils, face serum, hydrating skin, moisturizers Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

All of us have been through the time when we tried everything from ‘Dadi maa ke nuske’/ videos on youtube to treat it naturally to buying eye cream every now and then. You have heard the promises: Eye Creams reduce or even erase the signs of aging: Wrinkles, Dark Circles and Fine Lines. But are not the eye creams just a more-expensive moisturizer in a smaller package? Necessarily not. The skin around the eyes is more fragile, more prone to dryness, and quicker to show age and fatigue. Squinting and constant movement of the eyes also hasten the appearance of lines and wrinkles, and fluids collect under the eyes and cause puffiness and dark circles. Eye creams can address some of these issues. What Is Eye Cream? Fine lines and wrinkles come from both sun damage and your skin making less collagen as you age. Collagen helps maintain skin’s elasticity. Vitamin C, peptides, and retinol have boosted collagen production, studies of skin creams show. Ceramide and hyaluronic acid also help, these are moisturizers that help prevent water loss in the skin and improve elasticity. Many people believe that eye creams are simply moisturizers just thicker. In truth, they are unique because of what they exclude and what they treat. Eye creams contain no potentially irritating essential oils and only the mildest fragrance if any. Eye creams are lightweight and easily absorbed. Eye creams are specifically designed to treat dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness. Types Of Eye Cream There are two basic types of eye creams or gels. One is the one which you use during the day with your makeup to conceal and protect the area around your eyes from UV rays. It's typically lightweight and easily absorbed into the skin. It's much less likely to leave an oily residue. The other is used at night to repair and moisturize the eye area. It's more often viscous than a day cream or even a generalized night cream. Together they offer 24-hour support for your eyes. This is intensive therapy that works in addition to any generalized moisturizer you may be using on your face. The skin under the eyes is thin and lacks hydration and lubrication. That makes it dry out quickly and wrinkle faster than other areas on your face. If you fail to use sunscreen, smoke, indulge in alcohol regularly or tend to survive on less sleep than you should, your eye area will be of the first place to show stress and damage. If you are into vegan products then you can try out our caffeine and cucumber eye cream. The caffeine will make sure to reduce the lines and brighten the area under eye while cucumber will provide the hydration your eyes need. For best results use for 30 days after cleansing and toning for refreshing skin. Try our 100% natural Caffeine and Cucumber Under Eye Cream Why Do You Need Eye Cream? Healthy Skin is a very big deal at this time. Remember when a little olive oil on your hands would keep them looking youthful for a considerable amount of time? Indeed, you don't, however, your mother sure does. Today you need a degree in chemistry to search for just a normal moisturizer- disregard anything like sunscreen or oil cream. There are such a large number of details involved that you can't feel anything but overwhelmed. First, you're confronted with a list of ingredients you've never heard of; then comes the task of sorting through the hype to get at the facts. Do those impossible-to-pronounce ingredients actually do anything more than ratchet up the price? If they're effective, what core products offer the biggest bang for your hard-earned money? With all the creams, potions, enhancers, concealers and primers on the market, the prospect of investing in one or two can be bewildering -- and kind of annoying. Eye cream is a good example: If you already wear night cream and moisturizer, why do you need a special product for the area around your eyes? And why is that stuff, in its pitifully small bottles, so darned expensive? It turns out that your face is, well, complicated, too. It contains oily zones and hair follicles and sweat glands under the skin. It has a plump pillow of collagen for structural support. It also has an oily layer on the surface to help retain moisture. The list goes on and on and on. When it comes to taking good care of your aging skin (and it is aging every day), the eye area is at the forefront of the battle. Why? The answer is simple: The skin around your eyes is arguably the most delicate and vulnerable skin on your entire body. So it definitely needs extra hydration and care. And taking care of your skin can never do any wrong to you. How To Find The Right Eye Cream If you are a 20 something, your first priority will be to take care of the dark circles and puffiness and if you are above 30 something your main preference will be to use the products that help to take care of fine lines and signs of wrinkles. There are cream and gel-based eye products depending upon your skin type. Depending upon your age and circumstances, these descriptions will help you find the right eye cream according to your requirements. Moisturizing - Adding moisture to the skin is typically a two-part process that involves adding moisturizing ingredients and then following up with emollients to seal the moisture in place and ensure maximum absorption. Look for ingredients like niacinamide, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, shea butter, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, and essential oils. Reduce puffiness - The best products for reducing under-eye puffiness are marketed as having anti-inflammatory properties. Some common anti-inflammatory ingredients are tea extracts, allantoin, and Eyeliss (which contains protein peptides). Reverse the signs of aging - This can be a challenge, but newer cosmetic ingredients are helping in the fight to turn back the clock. Look for ingredients like retinol, hyaluronic acid and vitamin A, and peptides like palmitoyl oligopeptide and copper peptides. They stimulate collagen production, which in turn helps tighten the skin and improve its natural elasticity. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E can also be effective with regular use. Dark circles - Some eye creams have ingredients that break down dark blood pigment in under-eye skin. The most common ingredient using this technology is sold under the trade name Haloxyl. Reduce exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays -- Choose daytime eye creams with broad-spectrum SPF ratings of 15 or above. The ingredient coenzyme Q10 will also help protect the skin from sun damage. Fine lines and wrinkles -- Another ingredient sometimes used in daytime eye creams is caffeine. It tightens the skin, reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles. Continuing to smile throughout the day will reinforce wrinkles after a few hours, so for the best results - no, don't stop using your facial muscles -- but do check your makeup, and reapply eye cream as needed. We should try to include using eye cream while we exfoliate our skin as the eyes show the first signs of dullness and aging. To avoid this use sunblock whenever you go out and include Vitamin A and E in your diet. aging, dark circles, exfoliation, wrinkles Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

An oily skin type has excess oil on the face i.e it produces a good amount of sebum. Sebum is the substance which hydrates and moisturizes or skin.

Climate : If the climate of the place where you live is hot and humid, your skin is likely to produce more oil. This is why your skin is oilier in summers as compared to winters. Age : Adolescents and young adults are known to have oilier skin than the older lot. While this doesnt mean that your skin will become less oily. Also, oily can actually help in slowing down your skin aging as it keeps the skin moisturized as compared to those with dry skin. Enlarged pores : Aging, acne breakouts, and weight fluctuations can cause your skin pores to become enlarged. Enlarged pores can make your skin produce more oil. Use of wrong skincare products : some individuals may mistake their combination skin for dry skin and use a lot of heavy creams meant for the latter. This can cause the skin to retain more oil, possibly leading to clogged pores and breakouts. Nowadays, there are specific skincare products for oily skin, so choose yours wisely. Wrong skin care routine : Those with oily skin tend to wash their face at the drop of a hat. However, doing this will only give your skin temporary relief. It may, in fact, cause your skin to produce even more oil to make up for the loss. Skipping your moisturizer: Skipping your moisturizer can make your skin dry or oilier faster. Hence, use a light-weight, gel-based moisturizer if you have oily skin. How to care for oily skin with skincare products for oily skin? The following are the ways by which you can prevent the excess oil on your skin: Use a Face Wash for Oily Skin Washing your face regularly can reduce the amount of oil on the skin. The following methods are recommended for washing oily skin: Wash with a gentle face wash for oily skin and warm water. Avoid soaps with fragrance, added moisturizers, or harsh chemicals, which can irritate or dry out the skin, making it respond by creating more sebum. Avoid loofahs and rough washcloths, as added friction may stimulate the skin to make more oil. Use a Toner for Oily Skin Astringent toners that contain alcohol tend to dry out the skin. However, according to a 2014 study by cosmopolitan, natural astringents, such as witch hazel, can have skin-soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Neemli has the perfect toner for oily skin: Buy Organic Facial Toner Now Pat the face dry When drying the face after washing and using toner, people should gently pat their skin dry with a soft towel. This should be done with care, however. Pulling down on the skin with a towel, or using a rough washcloth, is not advised, as it may stimulate the skin to create more sebum.

You can use aloe vera, oatmeal, or honey in your mask to gently cleanse oil from your skin and prevent it from acne breakouts and it also makes your skin soft.

Use Sunscreen for Oily Skin Wearing sunscreen is a crucial step of any skincare routine. Neemli has a mattifying Sunscreen for oily skin which protects the skin while controlling the excess oil. Prevention Oily skin that is linked to genetics can be difficult to prevent. Even oily skin caused by changes in hormones is difficult to control. The best prevention for oily skin is for an individual to find consistent skincare products for oily skin that works, and to stick to it. When oily skin arises, it can be tempting to hide it with makeup. However, certain products can be tempting to hide it with makeup. However, certain products, particularly oil-based products, could make symptoms worse or clog the pores. Water-based makeup may be a better option for the same, while others find wearing no makeup works best for their skin. Many people also say their diet is what keeps their skin from acting up. It may help to stay hydrated, avoid greasy foods and trans fats, and eat a well-rounded diet full of whole foods. We should try to stay hydrated as much as we can because water itself cleanses away all the impurities and try to avoid excessive oily foods. cleansing and exfoliation once or twice a week can lead to better results. face mask, hydration, oily skin Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

But the real question is, what good do face masks do for the skin? Are they essential for your skincare routine? Is face mask for women different from men's? Should everyone use a face mask for glowing skin? I am going to answer every question with a single word: Absolutely. Face masks are the perfect skin care treatment to help you with your skincare concerns. The suitable face mask can help hydrate skin, remove excess oils and help improve the appearance of your pores. They are also an excellent way to help pull out impurities—another advantage of wearing a face mask: the feeling of having toned and smooth skin. Every healthy skin care regimen includes daily use and weekly use products. For example, you can use a face mask for glowing skin once a week, or you can use it more than that, depending on your skin and your skincare concerns. Using a face mask helps clear out the dead skin cells and rejuvenate our skin by making it smooth and glowing. It also helps to remove tan. Both men and women can benefit significantly from using a mask, and here is why. Benefits Of Using Face Mask for Glowing Skin: Fast and visible results : Unlike other skincare products, face masks don't have to be used continuously before you notice a visible difference in your skin. Masks can help skin look and feel smoother, refreshed, and replenished with moisture in minutes, perfect when you need instant results. Deep cleansing : Sure, cleansing each day helps to clean your skin by removing dirt, oil, makeup, and impurities from the surface of the skin. But did you know that proper masking takes the cleansing process to a whole new level? Only a good facial mask can help draw out impurities that hide beneath the top layers of the epidermis. Some people say that their skin goes through detoxing when they use a mask because they notice the changes in the skin while this is happening. Relaxation: Face masks don't just offer results that improve the overall appearance of your skin; they can also be quite therapeutic. A face mask can lift your spirit by stimulating your senses when infused with aromatic essential oils like mint and rosemary. Target every skin concern: just like your cleansers and moisturizers, face masks are also specifically suited to different skin types and problems. There are so many variants of face masks; no matter how troublesome your skin may be, you are guaranteed to find one which will quickly and efficiently treat whatever concerns you may suffer with. Unclog pores: Face masks do an excellent job cleansing deep into the skin, but they also work wonders in keeping the surface clean and clear. Not only do they get rid of dirt, but they also help remove the build-up of dead skin cells and absorb the excess oils that are clogging your pores. We all know by now that clogged pores can lead your skin down a wrong path. As impurities settle on the skin, they get pushed deeper down until they are trapped into the pores giving bacteria the chance to grow. This can lead to that one horrendous giant pimple or a flurry of unwanted breakouts that can be the bane of your existence for days. It's not a pretty sight! Glowing skin: face mask for glowing skin, especially those with tingly mint in the formulation, can help stimulate blood circulation. The process of the mask drying on your skin and beginning to harden, along with the removal of the mask, causes an expansion in the blood vessels in your skin. This ensures an overall improvement in skin tone. You'll be left with softer-feeling and smoother-looking skin, and you'll also notice a radiant glow and a more refreshed appearance. So, relax, feel the tingle, breathe in the minty aroma and wait for your skin transformation. Helps overall regimen : Masking helps all of your other skincare products work more efficiently. For example, if you want your day lotions, serums, and nighttime products to be absorbed by your skin quicker and deeper, then a face mask is a must. By masking regularly, you can ensure that your toning, hydrating and protecting products will all perform better, providing you with the results you're looking to achieve at a much faster pace. Blood circulation: Face masks boost and help stimulate blood circulation. The actual process of these power skincare products drying and hardening on your skin aids in promoting blood circulation on your face. This is because the blood vessels expand and more blood flows through the face, giving your skin much-needed nutrition and leaving your skin soft and smooth Aside from that, using a face mask also ensures an overall improvement of your skin tone. One use, and you'll notice a more radiant glow and a very refreshed appearance right after. So put on a face mask at home, relax, feel the tingle on your skin and wait for your skin's magical transformation. Better absorption: another unique benefit of using face masks is that it helps your other skincare products work better. Using masks regularly will ensure that your toning, hydrating and protecting products will perform better and faster as your skin can absorb them much more quickly. They make the most out of your skincare products by giving them a boost. Talk about giving you the best bang for your buck; face masks got your back! How to use Face Mask for Women and Men: Here we will answer your frequently asked question: how to use face mask, in detail. Step 1: Be prepared to make a mess. If you're going to use a face mask while relaxing in the tub, you don't have to worry about making a mess. You can cover your face, neck, and throat and relax. If you don't have time for a bath, then take the time to pull back your hair, so it's not near your face. Be sure to wear clothing that you don't mind getting messy. Step 2: Use your daily cleanser to remove all surface dirt, oils, and makeup before applying your mask. This will help to ensure that you receive all of the benefits your face mask was designed to deliver. Step 3: Using damp hands, apply your mask directly onto your damp skin. Never rub the mask directly into your skin. Be sure to avoid the eye area, keep your nostrils clear and extend the mask from your face, down your neck and throat. Nothing worse than a young-looking face and an old wrinkly neck, right? Buy four clay face mask now . Step 4: Wait, You can use these 10 minutes to relax, style your hair, check your email—whatever you want. Just be conscientious of the time and follow the directions. If the directions say you should leave on for up to 15 minutes, then that's what you need to do. Just don't leave your face mask on for 20 or 30 minutes. The product benefits are tied to the directions for usage. Be sure to follow them exactly. Step 5: It's time to remove the mask. Masks are designed to adhere to your skin. You don't want to be too rough when removing it. Use plenty of water and a washcloth to gently wash away the mask. Pat, don't rub; your skin dry with a towel. It doesn't get any easier than that when it comes to using a mask. Apply a face mask at home, once or twice a week, and you will see the results yourself. They are good for every skin type and help to detoxify your skin and keep it hydrated. cleansing, glowing skin Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

In a world where everyone is obsessed with the Korean beauty regimen, the former is a requirement. What's standing between you and clear skin? It could be the absence of just one product in your beauty routine. For Dr. Hadley King, a New York City-based, board-certified dermatologist, the secret weapon to healthy skin is a face toner. For years, dermatologists and estheticians have gone back and forth on whether swabbing our face with a toner-soaked cotton ball is helpful or harmful to skin health. But this argument isn’t about toners — it’s about alcohol in the toners. It’s a common belief that toners with alcohol are an essential step to killing acne-causing bacteria, but it’s also a double-edged sword. Though alcohol does fight bacteria, it also strips the skin of moisture. “Alcohol actually dries your skin out, which makes issues like acne even worse,” says Coco Pai, a licensed esthetician with over 25 years of experience and the owner of CoCo Spa in San Francisco, CA. This may be why some dermatologists say toners aren’t necessary, but there’s one important distinction to make: Not all toners have their roots in alcohol. What Is A Skin Toner? https://www.instagram.com/p/B2gsAs0FvIS/ Toners are often misunderstood and most people don't know if they should use it or how to use it. Before moisturizing and following your facial cleanser, a face toner is a quick, absorbing liquid that helps to remove excess dirt, traces of oil and makeup, correct and balance the pH of your skin, and helps control acne. In other words, a facial toner thoroughly cleans the skin and helps remove built-up surface dead skin cells. By helping to clean and close pores, it's especially beneficial for acne-prone skin. What Does Toner Do? Toners are most helpful and necessary for people with oily or acne-prone skin, or for people who want extra cleansing after wearing makeup or any other heavy skincare products such as sunscreen. But that is not all that toner can do. The following are some of the additional benefits: 1. It shrinks pores: Applying a small amount of toner to a soft cotton ball or pad and gently blotting and wiping your face with it will remove oil and give the appearance of smaller pores. 2. It restores your skin's pH balance: Our skin is naturally acidic, typically with a pH balance of between five and six (on a scale from 0 to 14). But that balance can get out of whack after cleansing due to the alkaline nature of soap. When this happens, your skin needs to work overtime to return to its normal levels (and that may result in oil), but using a toner can help restore this balance quickly. 3. It adds a layer of protection: Toners can help close pores and tighten cell gaps after cleansing, reducing the penetration of impurities and environmental contaminants into the skin. It can even protect and remove chlorine and minerals present in tap water. 4. It acts as a moisturizer: Some toners are humectants, which means they help to bind moisture to the skin. 5. It refreshes skin: Toner can also be used in lieu of washing your skin when it's oily or dirty. It will leave your skin revitalized even when you're on the go. 6. It can prevent ingrown hairs: Toners containing glycolic acid or other alpha hydroxy acids can help to prevent ingrown hairs, so it also aids in grooming. Why Do We Need It? Buy Witch Hazel face toner now Toners can help to close the pores and tighten cell gas after cleansing, reducing the penetration of impurities and dust particles into the skin. It helps in binding moisture to the skin. Adding a toner is a great way to take your skincare routine to the next level. While in the past they've been known for sucking moisture out of the skin with alcohol or witch hazel, the truth is a good toner is loaded with antioxidants and skin-restoring and skin-replenishing ingredients that nourish the skin. What is the Purpose of a Toner? The following are the purposes of a facial toner: What Can Toner Do For Your Skin? Face toners prep the skin for moisturizers and serum while getting rid of excess oil and stubborn dirt or makeup leftover on your face after you wash it, says the world-famous dermatologist Dr. Kim. But they're not a replacement for washing your face. Just think of facial toners as the extra credit rather than the shortcut of your skin-care routine. But the reformulated toners of today go beyond that basic role. “They are used to target a varying array of skin concerns—from acne to dryness to aging\". Like their predecessors, some toners are formulated for oily skin. \"A toner with a combination of glycolic and salicylic acids can keep oily skin matte throughout the day,\" says Estee Williams, MD, a dermatologist in NYC. But now there are toners for drier skin types that contain hydrating ingredients. \"Some newer formulations are even toner-serum hybrids with more substantial gel or lotion textures.” The three keys to protection by toner: Do you skip the toner step in your daily skincare routine? Next time, consider the benefits that facial toner offers, not only does it shrink your pores but it refreshes your skin and cleans up what your soap left behind. Here are three reasons why you shouldn’t ditch toner: Say goodbye to oily skin: After months of moisturizing to fend off the dry skin of winter, it is time to brace yourself for the oily summer months. If your skin glistens in the sun, it is time you thought of using toner. Opt for an alcohol-free toner so that it doesn’t remove your skins necessary oils. Clear complexion : Toner can help you achieve that perfectly poreless look. One of the benefits of using a toner is, it removes whatever your facial cleanser left behind. It gets rid of any remaining makeup residue or oils that sit in your pores, giving you a clean complexion. Refresh: Toner is your skin’s wake up call. It instantly refreshes and also works as an anti-inflammatory, waking up your skin's senses and leaving behind that puffy and tired I was up all night look. Jot this down as a go-to skin hangover cure! Choosing A Toner For Your Skin Type: First of all, it's important to always use an alcohol-free face toner. The other ingredients should be picked based on your skin type. Buy Rose and Patchouli toner now For acne-prone skin, choose an alcohol-free toner with alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). This will leave your skin clean and glowing without flaking. A gentle tingle for a few seconds will let you know it has just the right amount of pH of acid solution. This form of acid is gentle even for sensitive skin, unlike irritating ingredients like retinoids. Salicylic acid is often recommended in a facial toner for acne-prone skin. However, this ingredient can be harsh, specially for sensitive skin. Other ingredients for normal to combination skin may include coenzyme Q10, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and vitamin C. Although essential oils and plant extracts have had marketing to help give them a 'natural' and 'good for you' feel, these ingredients may result in skin irritations. How to apply it? If you are also thinking about the right way to apply toner, but not sure at which process you should use it, here are the steps to help you out : Start by cleaning your face with a gentle cleanser suited for your skin type. Choose one free of harsh detergents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and fragrance. After cleansing and rinsing pat your face dry with a clean towel. Dampen a cotton ball with the toner, and apply it on your face. Allow it to dry. If you have combination or oily skin, you can use alcohol-free toner at day and night. For dry skin, it's best to only use it once a day at night time. Always follow with a moisturizer for your skin type. Pro Tip: Make sure to leave your skin damp with toner when you use your moisturizer, it will help to seal in the hydrating properties. Toner helps in cleansing away the dirt and oil from your face, leaving it hydrated and fresh. The regular use of toner helps to clean the skin from all the pollution. hydration, moisture, witch hazel Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

Each time we eat, the food is broken down by our digestive system, and the liver is flushing away harmful toxins. However, when we put something on our skin, up to 60% of the synthetic chemicals may enter the bloodstream and build up in our bodies. Using chemical-free products (natural and organic) for our skincare routine makes perfect sense. Think about all the products we are using every day that come in contact with our skin: makeup, fragrances, moisturizers, soaps, deodorants and so on. It is not only what we eat what matters, but also what we put on our skin! Everything we could ever need to stay healthy and happy nature has already created for us! Just like you nourish your body with organic food, your skin deserves care with organic beauty products. Many non-organic beauty products on the market today include an astonishing amount of scary chemicals. From parabens (chemicals linked to cancer) to formaldehyde to petroleum waxes, an ordinary lotion can contain quite the toxic mixture. Certified-organic skincare products cleanse, tone, exfoliate and moisturize your skin without using any of these noxious artificial chemicals or additives. That’s not all, though. Your skin is the largest living, breathing organ on your body. Up to 60% of what you apply on your skin gets absorbed into your bloodstream, which then gets circulated around your whole body. But if you knew what toxins non-organic skincare products contained, you would think twice before you use it. So it's no surprise to see more and more people switching to organic skincare products. Benefits of using organic skin care products: If you're still using non-organic products, it's time to reconsider. Read on to learn the benefits of organic skincare products to see how they can be better for you. 1. Non-organic skin care products contain harmful ingredients: Pick up a bottle of any non-organic skincare product and read its ingredients label. How many ingredients can you actually recognize? Non-organic skin care products contain synthetic, man-made chemicals such as sodium laurel, mineral oils, Laureth sulfate, and toxins that could be residues of pesticides. Studies have also found that they can contain mineral oil, petroleum, parabens, and other chemicals that, with long term use, can cause skin irritation, hormone imbalance, organ toxicity, and even cancer. 2. Organic skincare products are made of natural ingredients: Now read the ingredients label of any organic skin care product. You'd probably recognize most, if not all of the items there. Certified organic products are derived from plants and other naturally occurring ingredients. More importantly, those organic ingredients are grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and other additives or chemicals. With that, you can be sure your skin and body absorb only real, natural ingredients that aren't harmful. 3. Organic products are non-allergenic: Without harsh chemicals, organic skincare products are less likely to cause allergic reactions, inflammations or irritations. If an allergic reaction does occur with the use of organic products, it would most likely be due to a natural ingredient (such as peanuts or strawberries), which would be easier to identify.

Because they are grown without herbicides and pesticides, their organic ingredients are also free from that contamination, which means the same for your skin and body. Moreover, up to 95% of an organic skincare product's contents are active ingredients. In synthetic skincare products, on the other hand, active ingredients only make up 5 to 10% of its contents. 5. Going organic is better for your skin: The synthetic ingredients found in non-organic products may be fast-acting, but they are also invasive, causing harm that cannot be seen. Their chemical ingredients may provide instant gratification and visible results, but most of this only helps you aesthetically by smoothening out wrinkles, removing sunspots, and diminishing blemishes. With prolonged use, these chemicals may damage and weaken your skin as your body tries to cope with these foreign substances. As a result, oxygen exchange to the skin is reduced, causing premature aging and increased risk of developing sunspots. Using natural, organic skincare products, though, ensure that you get the real nutritional benefits from its ingredients. Natural organic ingredients such as coconut oil, honey, aloe vera, and shea butter, for example, are known to soothe, nourish, moisturize and promote smooth skin. Even though the results may be slower, organic skincare products are gentle on your skin and won’t harm you in the long run. 6. You're supporting cruelty-free skincare products: The beauty industry has received backlash for conducting animal testing for their products to ensure that they are safe for human use. Organic products don't need to, because, with natural ingredients, they're safe and harmless! When you buy organic Skincare products, you are buying cruelty-free skincare products and also supporting the move towards abolishing animal testing in the industry. 7. You're helping to preserve the environment: Because organic products use naturally grown ingredients that are free from toxic pesticides and fertilizers, they don't leave a harmful footprint on the planet, particularly the soil, water, and air. Organic farming is also better for wildlife, causes lower pollution from pesticide and fertilizer sprays, and produces less carbon dioxide and less dangerous wastes. By using organic products, you're helping to minimize your environmental impact and support the sustainability of our environment. When you use organic beauty products , you can help minimize your environmental impact. First, you won’t have to worry about chemicals going down the drain because there won’t be any in the bottle. You can also look for organic beauty brands that obtain their ingredients from Fair Trade sources or from local farms and suppliers. And, be sure to check out companies that package their products in glass or biodegradable packaging. Better yet, going organic is sustainable and better for the environment, too. So invest in your health today and make the change to organic skincare products if you haven't already done so. cruelty free, organic, vegan Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

Maybe it’s because the idea of putting oil on, say, your acne-prone face seems certifiably insane (it isn’t), or maybe your skin is so sensitive you think you can’t use an oil (you can), or maybe you just think the whole concept of face oils is too confusing for your low-maintenance needs (it definitely is not). Whatever the reason, we're here to shout from the rooftops that face oil is the one product that can actually treat your skin issues, while giving you the bright, glowy, clear face of your dreams. And yes, every single skin type can use it (according to me, your derm, and your derm's derm). So to prove it to you—and to give you zero further excuses to forego an oil-filled life—we broke down the very best face oils for your oily, sensitive, dry, broken-out, and, yes, even your \"normal\" skin ahead. Better still, celebrity esthetician Renée Rouleau walks us through exactly how to use them for maximum glow. Different Types Of Skin Types And Face Oils Suited For Them: Face oil for Oily Skin : It sounds counterintuitive, but the right oil can not only act as an astringent to rid your face of excess grease but will also help stabilize and regulate your skin’s sebum production (i.e. your natural skin oil) to make you less oily overall. And let's get the whole texture issue out of the way: because of their different molecular weights, many oils feel more like a serum or essence so you're not stuck feeling sebum-ridden. Sealing in moisture and using the oil as the last step, after moisturizing. \"When you use a moisturizer for oily skin, it’s generally lightweight and oil-free so you want these ingredients to absorb into the skin first to avoid any potential blocking or clogging of the pores. Then, you can add a protective layer of face oil for oily skin over your moisturizer to prevent water loss.\" What To Use: Jojoba Oil Not only is jojoba an incredibly lightweight and breathable oil (making it great for combination skin that still needs some moisture), but, because jojoba actually breaks down and dissolves sebum, it'll also help control your shine making it a great face oil for oily skin. Grape Seed Oil If your skin is incredibly oily—as in you’ve never once felt a dry patch on your face—opt for grape seed oil. It’s a natural astringent (and a bit more drying than jojoba oil), so it’ll help mattify your skin. Dry skin : You would think that any face oil would automatically be a Cupid-level match for dry skin, but, like all things in beauty, it’s not that simple. Some oils are naturally more astringent and lightweight than others (like jojoba, grape seed, and pomegranate oil), so drier types want to use a rich oil that’s high in oleic acid—a fatty acid that helps condition skin, lock in moisture, and reduce irritation from dryness. \"Mix 3-5 drops directly in with your nighttime moisturizer, and apply to both the face and neck. You can also smooth over your moisturizer to provide a protective barrier to prevent dry air from pulling moisture out from the skin.\" What to use: Almond Oil It’s intensely hydrating and simple and gentle enough for anyone with eczema, dermatitis, or just really, really dry skin. It’s also incredibly high in vitamin A (i.e. the stuff retinol comes from), giving it some line-smoothing and zit-fighting power when used topically over time. Marula Oil This oil manages to absorb into skin within a few minutes of massaging it on, yet it’s still rich enough to moisturize and calm your dry skin all day—or night—long (thanks to a heavy dose of fatty acids). Acne-prone skin : What if I told you the key to reducing your breakouts is to slather your face with oil? Too late—that’s exactly what I’m telling you. Most acne treatments on the market are filled with irritating ingredients that strip your skin of natural oils. When your skin is dry and inflamed, it overproduces sebum, leading to pimples and blackheads. Acne-safe essential oils for face, however, work to nourish your skin, so your body can heal the zits you have without causing more. Kill ‘em with kindness, right? Rouleau suggests following the same routine as for oily skin, as the last step. If you’re still terrified an oil will worsen your skin, try patch-testing one on the most acne-prone area of your face (it’ll be the most reactive spot, and therefore the most accurate) for a week to see what happens. If your skin doesn't break out (any more than usual, anyway), massage a few drops of oil over your skin at the end of your skincare routine at night. What to use: Pomegranate Oil Not only is it naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory (so it’ll help fight zit-causing bacteria in your pores while also calming the rest of your inflamed, broken-out skin), but it’s also incredibly lightweight, so it won’t feel like a greasy mask. Rosehip Oil When you want to treat irritated, angry, red, zit-riddled skin, you bring in the big guns—i.e. rosehip oil. The innocuous oil deeply hydrates the skin (without suffocating your pores) with fatty acids that also fade acne scars and reduce redness. (Don't believe me? This woman went viral for clearing her acne with rosehip oil in only three weeks.) Best Face Oil for Glowing skin: If you don’t really break out, you’re not super dry, definitely not too oily, probably not sensitive, and your answer to every skincare question is, “Uhh, maybe? I don’t think so...” Then congrats! You have perfectly average, “normal,” I-hate-you-worthy skin. This means you can use a basic, OG face oil without having to worry about clogged pores, irritation, or dryness. \"Normal skin is less dry, so less of the oil is needed, compared to a dry skin type\". Try mixing in 2-3 drops into your nighttime moisturizer. Another hot tip from the glow queen: never mix in oil with a sunscreen/moisturizer hybrid, no matter what type of skin you have. A sunscreen moisturizer is an FDA-approved product and thoroughly tested to ensure that the SPF number listed on the bottle or jar is truly giving protection from damaging UV rays. If you alter its original formula by mixing in oil, you cannot be confident that you’re getting adequate benefits to prevent wrinkles, brown spots, and skin cancer. What to use: Argan Oil Meet the only face oil for glowing skin you’ll ever need for your perfectly chill face. It’s rich and soothing, it sinks in quickly, and it’s incredibly high in vitamin E—an antioxidant that helps prevent skin damage, dark spots, and fine lines by blocking environmental damage. Massage it on in the morning or night (or both!) as the final step of your skincare routine. Retinol Oils Okay, fine, this isn't actually a type of oil, but I know how you normies are—you want to see results, or you won't stick with the product. Welp, a gentle retinol-spiked oil will brighten your tone, clear your breakouts, smooth your bumps, and hydrate your skin, all without hardcore irritating your face. Use one every other night after moisturizing, and if you don't actually use a moisturizer, go get a hydrating one ASAP, since retinol can slowly dry your skin out, leading to legit skin issues. Sensitive skin: If you have sensitive skin, you need a face oil specifically designed to wrap your skin barrier in a soothing, nourishing, coddling hug. And that means finding a formula that’s bland, bland, bland, with absolutely zero essential oils for face—like lavender, peppermint, and rose—which tend to only irritate sensitive skin. Whichever oil you choose, Patch Test it first (dab it below your ear near your jaw) and wait 24 hours to check for a reaction. If your skin seems happy, you can massage it on in the morning, at night, or both, as the last step of your skincare routine. What to use: Moringa Oil This overachieving oil is packed with antioxidants (to protect your skin from irritating free radicals), fatty acids (to help repair a dry, damaged skin barrier), and anti-inflammatories (to calm irritated skin). It’s also lightweight, yet still moisturizing enough for dry skin, so you can easily layer it under makeup without creating a gunky mess. Aloe Vera Oil Just like moringa oil, aloe oil is filled with anti-inflammatories and antioxidants, but it also has the added bonus of being a natural antibacterial and astringent, making it a powerhouse for sensitive skin that’s also oily or acne-prone. Face oils are great for your skin as they help in opening up the clogged pores to maintain good blood flow and they have antioxidants that protect your skin from aging and keep the skin hydrated and moisturized. You can always trust a face oil for glowing skin that radiates through out every room you walk in. antioxidants, essential oils for face, face oils, glowing skin, hydration, moisturize Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

The onset of wrinkles, probably the one thing no one ever wishes to see. Wrinkles are the result of a lack of moisture and elasticity of the skin. This happens mainly due to aging but some environmental factors also have a role to play. Sun exposure, pollution, smoking or nutritional deficiencies are some more factors responsible for the creases on your face. Wrinkles, also known as rhytides, are folds in your skin. As you age, your skin produces less of the proteins collagen and elastin. This makes your skin thinner and less resistant to damage. Environmental exposure, dehydration, and toxins can all make your face more likely to develop pronounced wrinkles. Wrinkles are a natural part of getting older, and there’s no reason to dread getting them. But if you would like to slow the signs of aging on your face, chances are that you would want to buy cosmetics and anti-wrinkle, anti-aging creams to get rid of them. Now the price tag on such creams is good enough to give you stress, not to forget the harmful chemicals present in such cosmetics which could make things worse. What if we told you that you can mitigate those creases with the help of simple home remedies? Natural Ways To Take Care Of Wrinkles: To begin with, you need to stick to a healthy diet to make up for nutritional deficiencies if any. After this, you can try these simple home remedies to get rid of wrinkles. Take a look. 1. Olive Oil Olive oil is another natural and effective home remedy for wrinkles. All you need to do is massage a few drops of this oil on your skin before bedtime. Now clean it with a towel. You will wake up to soft and supple skin. 2. Lemon Juice This vitamin C rich fruit can be a great way to treat wrinkles naturally. Just slice some lemon and squeeze its juice into your fine lines and massage it all over. Acidic properties of lemon will help your skin look brighter and will mitigate the wrinkles as well. Be mindful of the portions though, excess lemon can be harmful to your skin. 3. Aloe Vera Aloe vera is rich in malic acid which improves skin elasticity. All you need to do is take some gel from the leave and apply it to your skin as it is. Wait for 15 minutes or till it dries and then wash it off. You could also mix the gel with some vitamin E oil and apply it on your face for the same effect. 4. Bananas When we refer to a healthier diet, it is much more than just eating these nutritious foods. You can use these foods for topical applications as well. Bananas can also be used for this purpose. Its nutritional properties fight the causes of wrinkles. Mash two bananas and form a paste. Now apply it on your face and let it lest for half an hour and then wash it off. You could also mix it with some avocado and honey for the same effect. 5. Carrots Carrots are rich in vitamin A which promotes collagen production, thereby keeping the skin smooth and wrinkle-free. For this, you can apply a carrot paste on your face every day. Just boil some carrots and blend it into a paste with some honey. Apply it on your face, rest for half an hour and then wash it off. You could also eat them raw. 6. Pineapple Pineapple has enzymes that offer multiple benefits for your skin. These enzymes improve skin elasticity, moisture and it eliminates dead skin as well. It is rich in fibers, antioxidants and it boosts skin health as well. All you need to do is rub some pineapple flesh on your skin directly and leave it on for 20 minutes. Once it dries out, wash it with cold water. 7. Drink water One of the easiest ways of keeping your skin wrinkle-free is by drinking lots of water. It is the best way to keep skin hydrated and maintains moisture as well. Drink two liters of water every day to keep your skin wrinkle-free. Other than going all-natural for your skin, there are a few ways in which you can avoid getting wrinkles in the first place: 1. Wear sunscreen Most people know that wearing sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) over 30 can help prevent skin cancer. A 2013 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that sunscreen also helped delay the signs of aging. While you probably already wear sunscreen for the beach, wearing a moisturizing sunscreen on your face each day is a habit that will benefit your skin health long-term. 2. Limit your sugar intake The medical community continues to learn more about how sugar consumption can affect your health. Sugar in your body sets off a process called glycation, and advanced glycation end products (called AGEs) are no good for your skin. AGEs break down the collagen in your body and, over time, can make you look older. AGEs have also been linked to food preparation methods such as grilling and frying (as opposed to baking and boiling). Limiting your intake of sugar and oil-rich foods will help your face retain its youthful shape. 3. Cut out smoking Smoking is bad for your health for lots of reasons, but many people don’t know that it can age your face prematurely. One fascinating study compared the faces of 79 pairs of identical twins in which one had a smoking habit and the other one didn’t. The striking differences in their ages made it clear that smoking does affect the condition of the skin on your face. Even being around secondhand smoke can increase your risk for many cancers and other diseases, and it may hurt your skin as well. 4.Switch up your sleep position Some wrinkling on your face can actually be caused by the position that you sleep in. It’s called “compression,” and it’s caused by your face pressing against the pillow, in the same way, every night. Over time, this compression leaves your skin weaker in some places than others, and a wrinkle forms. You can prevent or slow down compression wrinkles by sleeping on your back. 5. Wash your face regularly Taking that extra three to five minutes to wash your face at night is never a waste of your time. When you leave makeup on your face overnight, your skin absorbs most of it. Since most cosmetics contain harsh chemicals, this contributes to the oxidative stress your skin faces. That’s why taking an extra three to five minutes to wash your face at night is never a waste of time. Avoid vigorously scrubbing your face. Use a water-based wipe to cleanse your face before you go to sleep, and finish your wash with some cold water splashed across your skin. 6. Avoid ultraviolet light Ultraviolet light is the ultimate cause of most wrinkles on your face, neck, arms, and hands. And while ultraviolet light can’t be completely avoided, there are steps that you can take to lessen the degree of exposure that you receive. Opt for a sunless tanning lotion over long sunbathing sessions in the sand, and wear a hat that shields your face from the sun during long periods outdoors. When possible, wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when you’re adventuring outdoors. You’ll still absorb some sunshine, but you won’t be contributing to the wrinkles on your skin. 7. Up your antioxidants Skin is exposed to more oxidative stress than any other organ in your body. That means your skin can be damaged just by going through your daily routine. Antioxidants help fight the damage that oxidative stress does to your cells. While you can purchase a sunscreen or wrinkle cream enriched with antioxidants, there are plenty of other ways to get that antioxidant boost for your skin. Eating a diet rich in blueberries, kidney beans, grapes, kale, and spinach will help you get healthy skin “from the inside out” and could reduce the signs of premature aging.

These botanical extracts can be used in a variety of ways, but because they’re so concentrated and powerful, they’ll always need to be diluted in a carrier oil or a butter-like shea or cocoa butter. You may enjoy using your facial and skincare products, but how many ingredients are listed on there that are not natural? Let’s take a step back, and look at some natural, essential oils instead. It’s surprising how many ailments and issues these oils can help alleviate. On a quick note, let’s get to know first what essential oils are? Essential oils are compounds extracted from plants. The oils capture the plant's scent and flavor, or \"essence.\" Unique aromatic compounds give each essential oil its characteristic essence. Essential oils are obtained through distillation (via steam and/or water) or mechanical methods, such as cold pressing. Once the aromatic chemicals have been extracted, they are combined with a carrier oil to create a product that's ready for use. The way the oils are made is important, as essential oils obtained through chemical processes are not considered true essential oils. Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that retain the natural smell and flavor, or \"essence,\" of their source. Now that we know about essential oils, let’s get to know their uses for smooth and glowing skin. 17 essential oils for your skin : For all skin types and sensitive skin: Essential oils: Geranium, helichrysum, lavender, neroli, Roman chamomile, rose Carrier oil: Jojoba oil, sunflower seed 1. Geranium: Geranium is a versatile oil that balances oil production, conditions skin, and is great for all skin types. Geranium can be added to moisturizers to help with over and underproduction of oil. Geranium is antibacterial and has a delightful floral aroma that has hints of rose in it. Not only can it boost the oil-balancing effects of any moisturizer, but it can also boost your mood at the same time! Recipe to try: Add geranium to mineral water for a moisturizing face mist. 2.

If you are feeling sore from an extra hard workout, add a few drops into a massage oil to massage tired muscles. 8. Cedarwood: Cedarwood has the highest level of the anti-inflammatory substance, known as sesquiterpenes, of any essential oil, according to Essential Oils . That’s why it works so well on inflamed and acne-prone skin. Cedarwood is an effective toner on oily skin and hair. Recipe to try: This calming bath oil doubles as a skin-soothing body oil. Cedarwood oil‘s anti-itch and anti-inflammatory properties are especially helpful in this homemade eczema balm. 9.

Recipe to try: Make your own make-up remover wipes. Dry Skin Essential oils: Clary sage, lavender, sandalwood, ylang-ylang Carrier oil: Avocado, Sweet almond, Argan 13. Clary sage: Various benefits to skin health can be observed when using clary sage.

In case you need a refresher: \"Anything below 7 is acidic, above 7 is alkaline, and 7 is neutral, like water,\" explains cosmetic chemist Ginger King. Few skincare topics have become as mired in confusion and worry as pH. How can two little letters have such an impact on our skin? As it turns out, how pH relates to our skin and the products we use is fascinating. The pH of your favorite cleanser, toner, and moisturizer affects your skin, whether you realize it or not. And chances are, it's not for the better. And despite the worry, finding a pH-balanced skincare is easier than you might think. We’ll put your mind at ease about using skincare products with different pH levels so you can get through your routine faster. n First thing first: Let’s break down what all this science-y stuff actually means. In case you don’t remember from high school—which, I’m going, to be honest, I definitely needed a refresher—the pH scale runs from 0 (acidic) to 14 (basic). Healthy skin has a natural pH level of between 4 and 5.5, so your skin operates on the slightly acidic side of things and the goal is to use products that will help keep it that way. That’s exactly why so many key ingredients and actives are acids. Need to moisturize? Slather on hyaluronic acid. Want to brighten? Get to work with the L-ascorbic acid. Feeling like you want to resurface skin? Try an alpha-hydroxy or beta-hydroxy acid. That retinol? Yep, it’s retinoic acid. And the list goes on and on (and on). What Is pH? 'pH' is short for 'potential to free hydrogen ions' and is a measure of how acid or alkaline any aqueous solution is. Applied to your health, it's basically a measure of how much oxygen is in your blood. The higher a liquid's pH, the more acidic and oxygen-deprived it becomes, with fewer free hydrogen ions available; the lower its pH, the freer hydrogen ions it has. The pH scale ranges from (0.0-14.0). A pH of 7.0 is considered neutral. Anything below 7 is considered acidic and anything above 7.0, alkaline. The pH of the skin is slightly more acidic and should sit at around (4.5 - 5.5). Acidity plays a key role in your skin by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and activating certain enzymes in your stratum corneum. When the skin's pH sits in a normal range, it stimulates the production and secretion of healthy lipids and natural oils that allow the skin to repair and heal itself and stay in a balanced state. The natural shedding process that occurs can be disturbed if the pH is not correctly maintained. All products at Neemli are between the pH level of 4 to 7. Examples Of pH Lemon Juice 2.0 Vinegar 3.0 Stomach Acid 1.5 - 3.5 Water 7.0 Blood 7.35 - 7.45 Baking Soda 8.0 Soap 8.0-11.0 Ammonia 12.0 Drain & Oven Cleaner 13.0 - 14.0 The skin is made up of various layers. The outer most layer, the stratum corneum is the protective barrier from the external environment. Sweat and sebum (lipids) sit on the surface of the skin creating an important physical and chemical barrier known as the acid mantle. It’s basically your skin’s first line of defense. If your acid mantle is disrupted the skin becomes more permeable and susceptible to bacteria, chemicals, pollutants, and other microorganisms. Once the barrier is impaired it becomes challenging to keep the skin hydrated and for it to repair itself. From first-hand experience, this is one of the worst-case scenarios because nothing you do seems to help. The pH of skincare products is super important. A pH difference of 1 may not seem like a big deal, but the pH scale is logarithmic, not linear, and works on 1 to the power of 10. To Understand The Significance Of The Scale: A pH of 5.0 is 10x more acidic than a pH of 4.0 A pH of 5.0 is 10x more acidic than a pH of 4.0 A pH of 3.0 is 100x more acidic than and a pH of 5.0 A pH of 2.0 is 1000x more acidic than a pH of 5.0 Products that are high in alkalinity can dilate and cause swelling of your skin follicles and increase the permeability of your skin. Changing the pH on a continual basis and repetitive use of products that aren't pH balanced can create problems. Emulsifiers found in moisturizers and cleansers tend to have a higher pH. Their alkalinity can disrupt the skin's acid mantle. Extreme pH levels can cause inflammation, irritation, dryness and skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, and redness. Ideally, the products you are using should stay within the pH range of the skin and sit around (4.5 – 6.0) Products you use regularly and leave on your face should be pH balanced accordingly and sit around the (4.0 – 5.5) range. A couple of exceptions would be an exfoliating product that contains alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA’s) that are used to create an acidic environment to assist with desquamation (shedding) of the skin. Another would be a professional treatment like a chemical peel that’s designed to neutralize the acidity of the skin. You can test the pH of products using pH litmus strips from a pharmacy or if you want to get techy, invest in a simple pH meter. If the pH of a product is less than 4 or more than 6 then you should discontinue using it. You can also test your makeup as well. Because soap is high in alkalinity (8.0-11.0) you should never use it on your face unless it’s specifically pH balanced and labeled as such. Buy from our variety of organic products at Neemli Naturals Different pH And Their Affects On Our Skin: High pH (8 to 14) Skin-care products with a high pH level (also known as alkaline) pose the biggest threat to your skin's pH and acid mantle. They'll make your skin feel smooth at first , but it'll be disturbed and rough in the long run. That tight, squeaky-clean feeling you might experience after washing your face is the truest sign of cleansers with a high pH and damaged skin barrier. They, as well as other alkaline skin-care products, tend to strip away sebum and natural oils. As a result, undesirable effects such as redness, inflammation, scaling, and dryness can occur. Your skin might even break out, just because you cleansed with an alkaline face wash. Low pH (1 to 6) Because products with a low pH are at a level closer to skin's natural pH, they will more effectively work with your skin and help cell turnover gently. They're more likely to keep skin bright and smooth, instead of flaky and angry. However, certain products can be too low of a pH for skin and irritate it. At-home peels and other acid-spiked products like to tend to have a lower pH level, making them great exfoliants but just as stripping as products with a high pH. Cosrx, in particular, counteracts the stripping nature of acids with soothing ingredients that still maintain a low pH. As for its low pH cleanser, Cosrx's lab researchers share that they use a milder form of surfactant derived from natural ingredients to cleanse thoroughly without irritating the skin. What's the ideal pH for skin-care products? You obviously want to look for skin-care products with a pH of 5.5. If anything, they could be as low as 4.5 and as high as 7. The general rule is \"slightly acidic is preferred for the best complexion”. If you are unsure of what exactly the pH of your favorite skin-care product is, you can check by literally pH-testing them with litmus paper. You should try testing the pH level of your products before you use them, and its never too late to change your products to organic ones. Not only organic products will be healthy for your skin but it will also balance out the pH of your skin for a beautiful glow. organic, pH balance, skin care Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

So there’s nothing worse than when despite your hard work, your skin isn’t bringing its A-game; it’s oily, it feels rough, or it’s prone to dry patches. If this sounds familiar, you could be making one of these common skincare mistakes. The good news is there’s often a quick and easy fix to address the skincare issue. We suggest you change your skincare routine and divide it into 5 parts for day and night as well. With skin science constantly evolving, it’s hard to keep up with the latest types of skincare products and the order in which to use them. Here’s your cheat sheet for the perfect daily five-step routine to get smooth, radiant, youthful skin. 5 step skincare routine (morning): We all know the importance of nighttime skincare, but a solid morning routine is just as crucial. Nighttime skincare aims to address skin issues before the regenerative process of sleep begins, but daytime skincare is all about protection and preservation. You can’t create a youthful complexion, later on, you can only maintain the one you have now. There could easily be twelve steps to the most effective morning skincare regimen, but let’s be real… nobody’s got time for that. If all you can do each morning is hit the high notes listed below, you’re well on your way to a flawless face all day long. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0zNKF8I2rE 5 step skincare routine for a healthy glow Buy our morning time skincare routine Step1: Cleanse (with a hydrating cleanser) With all the environmental stressors your skin faces on a daily basis, a cleansing routine, morning and night, is a must. Choose a gentle hydrating cleanser, like Neemli activated charcoal detox bathing bar. It gets down to business with its creamy texture that gently removes makeup and embedded impurities while leaving skin velvety smooth! Buy our cleanser from Neemli Naturals.com Application: While your face is still damp from step one, work your cleanser into a foam and allow it to sit as a mask on your skin for a couple of minutes if you have time (I usually use this time to brush my teeth), and rinse with cold water. Press a clean washcloth onto your skin to dry – do not rub. Step2: Tone (with a gentle toner) Toner is easily the most misunderstood skincare product and way more important than it receives credit for. Toner is the first barrier product you apply – good toner balances your skin’s pH and is intended to hydrate – not strip your skin the way your astringent did in middle school. Your toner is key to wrapping up the cleansing process, removing that last bit of dirt and oil sitting deep in your pores. Rose and patchouli pore tightening facial toner is a great choice with its light and watery texture. This clarifying toner penetrates the skin’s surface to clean and close pores, while gently exfoliating and prepping skin for the next stage of your beauty routine. Buy our toner from Neemli Naturals.com Application: PUT THE COTTON PADS DOWN. Anything you put between your fingers and your face has the potential to irritate the skin, so embrace the practice of pressing. Tap a few drops of toner around your face and press it into even application. Step3: Treat (with a nutrient-packed Essence/Serum) The most important (and expensive) step in your morning skincare routine – aside from sun protection – is an antioxidant-rich serum. Your face is up against a lot of agents that wish to do it harm throughout the day: exhaust fumes from the city bus, your dirty phone screen, your cortisol levels during a 3 pm conference call, etc. Serums see to it that none of those stressors live eternally as fine lines between your eyebrows. Whatever your skin concern is, there’s a serum for you. If you are looking for even skin tone and radiance, Hyralaunic and Vitamin C Serum is your new best friend. Buy serum from Neemli Naturals Application: The best thing about serums is that a little truly goes a long way, making that hefty price tag a little easier to stomach. Press a couple of pumps into freshly toned skin and allow them to absorb fully before moving on. Step4: Moisturize (with a lightweight and powerful skin firming cream) Buy our day cream from Neemli Naturals There is no such thing as skin that is too hydrated, and your sunscreen should not be the stand-in for moisturizer. These two products serve vastly different purposes and are not interchangeable, no matter how moisturizing your sunscreen claims to be. It’s smooth-skin sailing from here on out, so finish strong with a powerful face moisturizer. Argan and Rose Day Cream packs a punch of hydration, yes. But, this dreamy face cream also tackles the signs of aging. With daily use, skin becomes firmer, smoother and more radiant and fine lines and wrinkles appear less defined. Application: Press a thin layer onto the skin and allow for full absorption. Step5: Face Oil/ Elixir Your face is a fresh, clean slate at this point. Well done, you! Now, it’s time to give it a boost of hydration and nutrients with an essence/elixir, an Asian beauty secret that promotes surface skin cell renewal. Essences/Elixir reduces the appearance of wrinkles, improves overall tone and texture and leaves skin soft and radiant. Neemli Turmeric Root & Olive Squalane Elixir is enriched with skin regeneration properties. It is rich in vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids that enhance the skin’s natural rejuvenation process. Buy elixir from Neemli Naturals Application: Put a few drops on your skin and allow for full absorption. It may seem a bit heavy on your pocket but its daily use will help you realize how incomplete your skincare regime was without it. Routine add-on substitutes: Step 6: Sunscreen If you only had time for one skincare product each morning, it had better be sunscreen. Daily sun protection is as important as drinking water and paying your parking tickets on time, so there are zero excuses for not doing it. Application: Press a quarter-sized amount onto your face, and an additional quarter-sized amount onto your neck and décolletage. 5 step skincare routine(night-time): Buy our 5 step nighttime skincare routine from Neemli Naturals Skincare routine and requirement are different at day and night. Don’t worry there isn’t a huge difference between them. You just hold onto your 5 steps i.e Cleanse Tone Serum Moisturizer Elixir / facial oil For moisturizing your skin at night you can use Neemli Hibiscus & Saffron night cream to help you deeply hydrate your skin and lock the moisture for a healthy glow. Buy our night cream from Neemli Naturals You can also pamper your skin by using a face scrub once in a week to get rid of old skin cells and clogged pores and exfoliate it to let your skin breathe properly. The routine may seem that it’s a lot to do, but in fact, it’s not. It will take only 15 minutes of your time and within a month you will start noticing the importance of this regime yourself.

The beauty industry graph is at its peak and has already put its leg in the billion-dollar industry, making everyone believe that following a simple skincare routine is very important. Investing in your skincare products is not bad unless you are getting satisfying results. One understands the cost and time of getting healthy skin. Getting healthy skin is crucial to boosting your confidence and self-esteem level. But is running after cheap cosmetic and skincare products worth it? When it comes to skincare and cosmetics, where should we spend more, and where should we save? The answer to this is quite a debate in itself and highly depends upon individuals' skin. So lLet's dig into this and find out where to save and spend on skincare and cosmetic products. Where to save? Purchasing a cheap beauty product and thinking that you will get brighter and shinier skin is like an illusion. Using cosmetics that are cheap at cost can contain harmful chemicals that can damage the skin very much. Going with such cosmetic products will not empty your bank initially, but the result that you get from them will surely burn your bank later. Many cheap and duplicate products available in the market can surely attract and make you buy them. But in the long run, the result of these products can cost you even more. With the increase in demand and need, such simple skincare products have also spread their leg in the market. No doubt, they are giving tough competition to the original product in the price tag. But in the longer run, such products are the ones that will destroy your skin the more. Such cosmetic products will temporarily bleach your skin, making it look brighter and shinier. But after using it for a while, you'll realize that your skin is gradually losing the charm and looks like dead skin. Your skin will be lacking nourishment and will look pale, with no grace. Another side effect of using cheap cosmetic products is their fragrance. Their fragrance covers up various kinds of smells they're having and can also cause headaches. Don't get duped with ineffective or potentially harmful skincare products in the long race. Adopt A Minimalist Skincare Routine for Oily Skin When it comes to choosing a simple skincare routine for skin concerns, going for minimalist skincare is the best action plan. A minimalist skincare routine consists of only the most essential products for your skin. For example: here's a skincare routine for Oily Skin . Buy our day & night moisturizers . Where to spend it then? You should migrate yourself from using cheap cosmetic products and go for homemade natural products. They are more treatment-based and enriched with high-quality natural ingredients. They might cost you huge initially, but they will be worth every penny in the long run. Natural skincare products are an excellent value for money. They are indeed costly, but in return, you're giving your skin the best treatment. When you use homemade products, your skin will also get nourishment from inside and outside and make your skin look charming and glowing. Of course, such products will cost you a bit but will properly cure your skin to the root. Whereas cheap cosmetics products will show the best results in their initial phase and make you feel worth using them. But in the long run, such products will make your face dull and aging. Homemade products are made from natural ingredients, and so they don't change their fragrance usually. In addition, the presence of essential oil fragrance in Homemade products can also give aromatherapy to the person using it. So overall, applying homemade products to the skin is more beneficial than cheap cosmetics. And if you talk about where to spend and save in terms of natural and homemade cosmetics and skincare, I would recommend spending more on homemade serums, antioxidants, sunscreens, and night creams. This list can not be fixed for everyone, as every skin is different from the other. Check our Neemli Natural's Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum Consume more on natural homemade serums, as they contain many beneficial ingredients and penetrate deep inside the skin to benefit. To get better skin every morning when you wake up, go with natural antioxidants (Retinol) for the best results. I always prefer clinically proven natural homemade products for treating sun damage, aging, acne, etc. Stay away from products containing petrolatum and lanolin, as these are skin-harming ingredients and can damage your skin even more. If your skin is healthier and free from problems like acne, you don't need to spend much on moisturizer. Summing Up I hope this has made your mind clear enough about where to spend and where to save when it comes to a simple skincare routine. Buying a cheap $10 beauty product based on other suggestions and expecting the same result is a foolish thought. Think again and change your mind. Don't make decisions that can make you feel guilty in the long run. Spending time knowing the ingredients used in each product is one what you can make sure you are getting what you paid for. Your goal should not be to fill your wardrobe with x number of beauty and cosmetic products but to focus on natural and minimalist skincare products that should work for you. cost, effective, save, skincare Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

While you experimented with a multi-step routine for a glowy ‘zoom face’ or couldn’t find the motivation to prioritize your skin, things changed in the world of skincare. The search bar replaced offline browsing, social media became all encompassing and ‘maskne’ or mask induced breakouts became a real thing. Looking ahead, here are some skincare trends that we see growing in 2021: Hand Care The incessant hand washing, dish washing and sanitizing from 2020 has made hand care increasingly important. After a year of clinical-smelling sanitizers, our hands begged for everything luxurious – from indulgent body butters to pleasant hand creams that bring back that softness and hydration. If someone asks whether we believe hand care will find a place in 2021, we’ll definitely put our ‘hand up.’ 2. Preventive Routines Gone are the days where we felt a skincare routine was ‘optional.’ With greater awareness, the focus is now on dealing with skin issues before they ‘pop’ up. Whether it’s fighting off early signs of fine lines, dealing with regular toxins and sun-damage or caring for acne scarring, preventive skincare routines are going to cement their place in 2021. From barrier repairing serums enriched with hydrators like Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, to daily-use cleansers with replenishing ceramides , effective and protective products will continue to find their way to skincare shelves. 3. Label Transparency TBH, authenticity is an all-time trend, but with access to greater information, the demand for label transparency in skincare is going to have even greater importance in 2021. As the ‘clean beauty’ industry gets more crowded, there will be greater onus on the part of individual brands to ‘come clean’ about their ingredients. 4. Targeted Use of AHAs & BHAs Acids have been all the rage for the last couple of years and the fact that most people now understand the context of acids as hero ingredients rather than something scary, has sky-rocketed their popularity. After the initial boost, however, 2021 is likely to see more focused, targeted use of skincare products with acids. AHAs and BHAs with well-planned synergistic formulations in single products that target specific issues like acne and pigmentation serums are likely to be picked over multiple individual products that can lead to over-stimulation and irritation. 5. Online Consultations While dermatology moved online during the pandemic, buying skincare online was already showing an upward trend before that. With more than 91% consumers* now conducting their research for beauty and skincare products online, it will continue to be increasingly important for brands to provide the best recommendation tools for their skincare products. From skin quizzes to personalized consultations , skincare online is likely to see a big leap in 2021. acne, consultation, online, routines, serums, skincare, trends Older Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

Especially when it comes to your skin. While it may seem like a new skincare ingredient pops up with every refresh of your social pages, your skin will always love some of them that do well for it. Here’s a list of some of our favourite ingredients in skincare, which we think are here to stay! Hyaluronic Acid: Hydration never goes out of style, and in our books, nor does Hyaluronic Acid. A substance that is naturally present in the skin, HA levels start to decline as we grow older. Adding HA back into the skin helps with hydration and suppleness. A powerful humectant that keeps skin moisturized through the day, it also promotes skin healing by controlling inflammation. The Neemli Naturals Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C Serum pairs the humectant rich HA with the antioxidant properties of vitamin C, making it the perfect daytime anti-aging serum. Glycolic Acid: If you’re still saying “aha!” to AHAs, we’re with you. Glycolic Acid is one of the skincare industry’s favourite ingredients and for good reason. A great addition to acne-prone skincare, glycolic acid helps unclog pores and reduce redness. It effectively exfoliates dead skin cells from the upper layer of the skin, making it ideal to treat scars, skin discolouration, hyperpigmentation and dullness. While the Neemli Exfoliating Toner brings the exfoliating properties of glycolic acid together with the pH balancing properties of Apple Cider Vinegar for uneven, acne-prone skin, the Neemli Glycolic & Salicylic Acid Serum is a specially crafted serum to treat and prevent acne, unclog pores and reduce dark spots. Squalane: Naturally present in our skin, Squalane is a luxurious emollient that locks in skin moisture and protects against free radicals. Not to be confused with Squalene (with an e), which is derived from shark liver (eck!), Olive Squalane is plant-derived and helps in easing dry patches, fading dark spots and improving skin texture over time. It has both hydrating and antioxidant properties and in our books, that makes it quite the star ingredient! It works beautifully in the Neemli Turmeric Root & Olive Squalane Elixir , a glow-boosting facial oil that repairs and rejuvenates skin. Tea Tree Oil: Yes, we know this ingredient was all the rage a few years ago but the truth is, till those pesky pimples are around, tea tree oil will be around as well. This is because of its amazing anti-inflammatory properties that sooth inflammed and itchy skin. The properties in tea tree oil help in effectively destroying acne-causing bacteria and unclogging pores. When used in cleansers like this one , antioxidant-rich tea tree oil can help reduce and prevent acne, balance oil production and protect skin from damage. Oat Amino Acids: Considering amino acids are what our bodies use to construct proteins, we’d say this vegan version of it is indispensible in skincare. Derived from the hydrolysis of oat proteins, oat amino acids help with naturally moisturizing skin and balancing pH levels. They also help in not only rebuilding and renewing skin tissue, but also protecting skin from the detrimental effects of environmental exposure. Combined with other hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, oat amino acids work well in providing gentle cleansing and moisturization – even for sensitive and oily skin.

Well, that’s the thought we carry here while we tell you about the benefits of cucumber for your skin. Using cucumber can bring radiance to your skin and hydrate it as well. While luxurious skin treatments and fancy facials may seem enticing, you don’t always need to break the bank to get healthy, glowing skin. Sometimes, simple kitchen ingredients are exactly what your skin craves. For example, one of our favorite skin-friendly botanicals is cucumber! Read on to know more about the benefits of cucumber for your skin and unique ways to use it for glowing, dewy skin. We’re also here to tell you about refreshing cucumber face packs that you can make at home and apply to your face. Beauty Benefits Of Cucumber Cucumbers are known for being crunchy and cool, but they are also rich in antioxidants and superfoods for your skin. They have been used in skincare products for decades to address skin concerns like dehydration, pigmentation, acne, pimple marks, etc. Let’s take a look at the top cucumber benefits for the skin. 1) Reduces dark circles Putting slices of cucumber on your eyes not only relieves you from the stress of a long day but also helps you get rid of dark circles and puffiness. For best results, don’t forget to apply our under-eye cream after. 2) Reduces Skin Damage Cucumber heals the damage caused by prolonged exposure to the sun's harmful UV rays. You can also use it as a natural toner owing to its astringent properties. Just place cucumber slices over the affected area to calm sunburn , tan, and skin irritation. Thus, there is not one but several benefits of cucumber. 3) Skin Hydration Is The Key Benefit Of Cucumbers Keeping skin hydrated improves the texture and firmness of your skin. Maintain a healthy, glowing complexion by replenishing your skin with hydrating ingredients like cucumber. Similar to aloe vera, cucumbers contain polysaccharides, which help the skin attract and retain moisture. Cucumbers also consist primarily of water. This high water content is a key benefit of cucumbers, providing superior hydration to the skin. 4) Great for acne-prone skin Cucumbers are a mild astringent, meaning they tighten pores, help regulate oil production, and reduce pore size. Excess oil and large pores can lead to breakouts. So, if you have oily skin or acne-prone skin, then cucumber is just the thing for you! Now you know there are various benefits of cucumbers; we have highlighted a few, but they can address many skin concerns. In addition to having so many benefits for the skin, it can also be applied in many different ways. For example, you can make a cucumber face pack or a toner . Here’s how you can use cucumber to your skin’s benefit. 4 Cool Ways To Use Cucumber For Face 1) Cooling Toner Cucumber is the best toner for your skin - it is absolutely natural and has cooling properties which calm your skin and reduce irritation. Take a spray bottle, add some slices of cucumber and fill it with water. Leave it overnight, and your toner is ready to use. Spray it as and when you feel it’s too hot or sticky or if you experience any irritation or itching. 2) Skin Repairing Face Mask Cucumber can be used in various skincare applications, including using it as a cucumber face pack. Apart from soothing and calming the skin, cucumber also has skin-repairing properties and can treat blemishes and dark spots. In addition, the anti-inflammatory properties of cucumber soothe your skin at the deepest level, thereby helping fade blemishes. Cut cucumber, blend it, add a spoon of oats, and apply the thick paste to your face. Leave it for 20-30 mins and then wash it off. This will help you get rid of blemishes and acne scars naturally over time. Are you surprised with these homemade cucumber face pack benefits? 3) Face Cleanser Another easy way to take advantage of the benefits of cucumber for your skin is by rinsing your face with cucumber water. If your face generally feels greasy or icky during summer, prepare and store some cucumber water in the fridge and splash it on your face to keep the sticky feeling at bay. 4) Drink cucumber water Water is something your body needs to perform vital functions. From regulating temperature to maintaining a healthy digestive system, adding sliced cucumber to the water you drink is an amazing way to hydrate especially if you’re not fond of the taste of plain water. These were some super cool benefits of cucumber. So whether it’s a cucumber face pack or a toner, all that matters is that you have some cool cucumbers at hand!

First, it is the holy grail of exfoliation and is widely used to combat signs of aging, hyperpigmentation, dryness, and acne. The properties of the toner exfoliate dead skin cells from the skin’s surface, and this exfoliation reduces existing fine lines and wrinkles, fades hyperpigmentation, and clears acne. Derived from sugarcane, glycolic acid is also a humectant, which means it has the chemical ability to draw moisture to itself. We love the acid for the many superpowers it has, and a glycolic acid toner is one of the best products you can add to your skincare routine. The toner has various skincare benefits that we have listed below so that you can make an informed decision about adding it to your skincare routine. Glycolic Acid Toner Skincare Benefits 1) Reduces fine lines and wrinkles A glycolic acid toner can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by effectively exfoliating the top layer of your skin. This exfoliation accelerates skin cell renewal, and accelerated skin cell renewal increases collagen production and the skin's natural ability to retain hydration. As a result, it gives you younger-looking skin, reduces the appearance of pores, and improves skin texture. In addition, the exfoliating toner’s deep penetration increases collagen synthesis, preventing new fine lines and wrinkles from appearing on your face. 2) Hydrates your skin Not only does it exfoliate, but it also hydrates dry skin and balances pH levels. The toner chemically attracts water molecules to itself. This means the acid keeps your skin hydrated and replenishes healthy skin. 3) Brightens and improves skin texture The holy grail of exfoliation, glycolic acid, goes into the deeper pores, cleansing excess dirt and breaking the bond of dead skin cells. The toner helps make skin brighter, smoother, and softer with its exfoliating properties. 4) Fades hyperpigmentation and evens skin tone Glycolic acid strips away dead skin cells from the skin’s surface, revealing a fresh layer of skin with a more even skin tone. With consistent use, this process effectively fades hyperpigmentation. 5) Fights acne and scars The Glycolic acid helps clear out pores and prevent blockages and blackheads. This prevents acne from forming. Its exfoliating properties also remove dead skin cells, revealing a fresh layer of skin and reducing the appearance of acne scars. This toner can slow down the aging process if used regularly and keep your skin looking healthy while avoiding acne. These were the skincare benefits of the toner. Isn’t it terrific that using one toner can have so many advantages? Well, we told you it has many superpowers.

Like every mom and baby is unique, skin-related issues during pregnancy can differ from person to person. While a few (very lucky) moms-to-be may experience that coveted ‘pregnancy glow,’ a majority may have to deal with pregnancy skin problems like redness, acne, hyperpigmentation, and melasma. Dealing with skincare issues while keeping in mind your baby’s safety can be tricky. But here are some tips to help you rejig that pregnancy skincare cabinet to make it safe and healthy. Let’s talk about pregnancy-safe skincare brands in India, what you must include in your pregnancy skincare regimen, and what you must avoid during pregnancy. What to SKIP and what to USE in your pregnancy skincare routine: SKIP RETINOL, INCLUDE VITAMIN C Even though retinol is a superstar ingredient when it comes to anti-ageing benefits like reducing fine lines, wrinkles, pigmentation, and dark spots. It is not suitable to use during pregnancy. In addition, even though only higher concentrations have been linked to congenital disabilities, it is advised to stay away from all retinoids during pregnancy. Vitamin C, however, can be your go-to anti-ageing ingredient during this time. A legendary antioxidant, it helps promote skin elasticity and fight premature ageing while evening skin tone and brightening skin. In addition to this, it gives you retinol-like benefits but is entirely safe to use for moms-to-be. When put together with an excellent humectant like Hyaluronic Acid, it helps improve hydration and make skin plump and supple. Our Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serum is a perfect addition to your pregnancy skin care routine and sustains that pregnancy glow. SKIP CHEMICAL SUNSCREENS, INCLUDE MINERAL SUNSCREENS FOR YOUR PREGNANCY SKINCARE ROUTINE With your body being extra sensitive to everything around you. It is essential to have sunscreen as a part of your pregnancy skincare routine. However, Oxybenzone, an ingredient often used in chemical sunscreens, is endocrine-disrupting and could cause possible congenital disabilities. Switching to a mineral-based, broad-spectrum sunscreen during this time is a great idea. These sunscreens often contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which are safe to use and shield you from the harmful effects of the sun. Sun protection should be part of your everyday skincare routine, and when you’re pregnant, even more so! Our Mattifying Sunscreen can help protect your skin from hyperpigmentation, patches, and fine lines that result from pregnancy-related skin sensitivity. SKIP SALICYLIC ACID, TRY GLYCOLIC ACID Even though it’s great to treat acne, salicylic acid is not safe when used in excess during pregnancy. It’s best to avoid this in the form of peels, masks, and creams. However, it can be used in the form of a low concentration face wash or cleanser. If you’re dealing with breakouts during pregnancy (bright side - you can feel like you’re in college again), try our glycolic acid and apple cider vinegar exfoliating toner in small concentrations. It helps exfoliate dead skin cells, unclog pores, reduce fine lines and brighten skin. So switch it up and get the right skincare during pregnancy. OTHER INGREDIENTS TO AVOID ✖ Hydroquinone ✖ Caffeine ✖Benzoyl Peroxide OTHER SAFE-TO-USE INGREDIENTS ✔ Vitamin E ✔Hyaluronic Acid ✔Niacinamide It is advisable to get your doctor’s recommendation on a pregnancy skincare routine and products. If you’re doubtful about any ingredient, please check in with your doctor. To help make your journey a little smoother, here’s a handy list of pregnancy-safe Neemli products for great skin, along with benefits and tips for a pregnancy skincare regimen. Turmeric Root & Olive Squalane Elixir : A safe facial oil to give you that radiant glow Glycolic Acid & Hydrolyzed Collagen Pit Repair Concentrate : Perfect spot treatment to target pits, redness, and uneven skin texture Witch Hazel and Vetiver Pore Refining Facial Toner : A safe and handy hydration agent to refine pores, clarify skin and restore pH levels Glycolic Acid and Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner: Perfect to help with acne, sweeping away excess oil, and improving overall skin appearance Hyaluronic and Ceramide Face Wash : A gentle, 100% sulfate-free cleanser that locks in moisture without causing any irritation Hyaluronic and Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer : A gentle, lightweight, and safe moisturizer that leaves your skin hydrated, plump and youthful Pomegranate and Sea Buckthorn Body Oil : An ultra-indulgent blend of skin-loving oils to deeply hydrate and nurture your skin Kokum & Tamarind Body Butter : An intense and luxurious body butter to enrich and soften skin while reducing age-related blemishes and forming a protective layer around the skin skincare tips Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

Looking after oily skin is a challenge. Everyone wants to flaunt a fresh face all day long. Unfortunately, oily skin can take away some of that freshness and can sometimes cause skin problems. Excess oil can clog your pores and lead to acne, pimples , and blackheads. Brands have come up with various solutions like developing products like oily skin face wash or an oily skin moisturizer , but are they really working for you? While too much oil can lead to grease, breakouts, and acne, trying to over-cleanse your oily face only makes it oilier. This leads to blocked pores and more oily skin-related acne problems. So before worrying about washing your face too often or which oily skin face wash to use, let’s talk about ingredients that can help with oily skin and breakouts. Once you really understand what is good for your skin type, you can form your own oily skincare routine that works for you. Ingredients That Work for Acne-Prone and Oily Skin Here is a list of ingredients that are effective in balancing oily skin and getting rid of acne. Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar, just like any other vinegar, has antibacterial and pH balancing properties. Rich in malic acid, it gently exfoliates, unclogs pores work well on acne-prone skin, and reduces dark spots and hyperpigmentation. This is one of the key ingredients in the Neemli Naturals Glycolic Acid & Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner. This toner not only regulates oil production but also helps destroy the bacteria that causes acne. Green Tea Green Tea is very high in antioxidants. Drinking it or applying it to your face can maximize hydration and even out your skin tone. It may also help reduce acne. This is likely because the polyphenols in green tea help fight bacteria and reduce inflammation, which are the two leading causes of acne. Aloe Vera If you already have oily skin, it is not advisable to lather your skin with heavy everyday skincare products like heavy sunscreens. Instead, it is recommended to use a lighter sunscreen with soothing ingredients such as aloe vera extract rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Niacinamide An active form of Vitamin B3, niacinamide has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties that combat acne, regulate oil production and shrink pores, making it one of the most effective and safe active ingredients to use for this skin type. So if you’re looking for the right oily skin moisturizer for acne-prone skin, you can opt for one that has niacinamide as one of its key ingredients. Expert Tips To Have A Great Skincare Routine For Oily Skin If your skin produces too much oil, it is essential to cleanse it, but not too often. Twice-a-day cleansing with an oily skin facewash with the right ingredients is recommended. Avoid heavy, pore-clogging creams, but do not skip moisturizer. If your skin is too dry, it can lead to more sebum production. Instead, find the right oily skin moisturizer and use it daily to reduce overall oiliness. Beware of the kind of makeup you’re using because you don’t want to add a layer of oil due to the use of incorrect makeup for your skin type. Instead, opt for oil-free makeup products whenever you can. Consistency is key. Choose a skincare routine with products that work for you - be it an oily skin face wash or moisturizer and be consistent with it. You will notice that your oil levels will be more balanced over time, and your acne will reduce. Things to Avoid when you have Oily Skin Unexpected issues may be getting in the way of your oily skincare. Avoid consuming unhealthy things like fried food that may be contributing to the problem. Instead, make an overall change to your lifestyle and include oily skin and acne-fighting food rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, probiotics, and antioxidants. Stress is another factor that may be making your oily skin and acne-prone skin worse. It causes our bodies to release cortisol, which may lead to breakouts. This may not seem like a blunt tip for an effective oily skincare routine, but meditation and stress management can go a long way in preventing stress-related breakouts. Avoid clogging products that block your pores and trap oil underneath your skin. Look out for non-comedogenic on the labels for products you use. These will not clog your pores and are less likely to make your skin break out. Avoid sleeping on bed sheets and pillow covers that haven’t been washed. Over time, bacteria, residue, and dirt can build up and aggravate your oily and acne-prone skin concerns. So make sure to wash your linen at least twice a week. These were some tips and tricks to ace your oily skin care routine. Now that you know which ingredients work for your skin type and what changes you can make, say bye to a greasy face and get that healthy glow! beauty tips, oily skincare Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

Yes, Yes, I know it sounds weird and smells funny, but it is significant, and I cannot stress this enough, very essential for your skincare routine. There are several benefits a banana peel face wash can have on your skin, but even using raw banana peel is a great idea, and today we are going to explore a bit on that. Skin Brightening With Banana Peel Do you know what bright skin is? Skin that reflects light from within. Nah, I’m just kidding. However, I am sure you must have seen a few friends of yours who have glowing skin. Well, using a banana peel regularly on your skin will get you the same skin. You see, there are all these antioxidants in the banana peel that help your skin fight free radicals. So to put it simply, it makes your skin a fight club for free radicals and antioxidants, and the antioxidants always win. And then you too can have bright and glowing skin to reflect light. Hydrates and Moisturizes Dry Skin Dry skin is a common problem, and you can’t heal it by just getting it wet. You need some moisture that flows within the skin. Well, you’re in luck because Banana peels are rich in amino acids and vitamins A, B, C, and E. Now I’m not sure if you have heard, but these vitamins are miraculously invigorating for dry and itchy skin. So logically, the reason for any skin to be dry would be lack of moisture and dehydration of the skin, and the silica in bananas increases collagen production that hydrates the skin and keeps it beautiful. Banana Peel Removes Acne and its Scars. So we conversed about Vitamin C and A, right? Did you know that it always helps you get rid of acne and its scars? Isn’t that amazing? I mean, I’m thinking about growing a banana tree in my house. So the anti-inflammatory properties and these vitamins in the banana help you get off acne and reduce hyperpigmentation. Of course, you need to start rubbing banana peels on your face to get truly pulchritudinous skin. In addition, there are phenolics in the banana peel that have properties that help remove other acne-related problems. Reduce dark circles and puffiness It is a known fact that the skin around your eyes is pretty sensitive. And that is the reason why it gets puffy, and sometimes you see dark circles around your eyes. So here’s yet another benefit of the banana peel. Placing the banana peel on closed eyes will help increase blood flow around your eyes and soothe the delicate skin below your eyes. So yeah, now that you know a natural way to remove your dark circles, there is no longer a need to follow Christian Bale’s American Psycho routine. Banana Peel For Sun protection (Believe it or not) The vitamins A, C, and E found in banana peels are extremely helpful for sun protection. Now I’m not suggesting using banana face packs instead of sunscreen; that would be weird. But using banana peels can strengthen the ability of your skin to prevent damage caused by the sun. Not only does it make your skin vigorous, but it also helps remove sunspots or liver spots with vitamins A and C. Don’t worry; liver spots are not at all related to your liver. They are just another name for sunspots. Wrinkle Reduction Wrinkles are one of the leading indicators of the fact that your skin is aging. Now you can’t really stop time, but you can slow the aging of your skin. Let me explain how and why you get wrinkles. So as time passes by, your skin gets older and produces fewer and fewer collagens every day. Because of this, it doesn’t get the nutrition it needs to stay rigid. And thus, getting thinner and weaker when it comes to fighting harmful microbes and, “voila,” there you have it, Wrinkles. With the help of the collagen produced by banana peels, you can strengthen your skin and gradually get rid of wrinkles. And the antioxidants will give it the energy it needs to get rid of harmful bacteria. You can also practice regular use of Neemli Naturals’ rose and argan day cream to make your skin tighter and brighter. So these were the peerless benefits of banana peel for the skin. So now that you know the magnificent things that banana peels can do for your skin, I think you should try using them for your skin regularly. And once you use the banana peels on your skin and rinse it off, you can use Neemli Naturals’ Rose and Argan Day cream to moisturize and preserve the beauty of your skin.

Yeah yeah, We know. Don’t worry, though; We’ve got you covered. One of the most common skin types is dry skin, and if you have been looking around everywhere for the right skincare routine for dry skin, your search ends here. Today, we will discuss the causes and the best skincare routine for dry skin and how the routine can make your skin look glowy, hydrated, and healthy. So, shall we? What Causes Dry Skin? If you have dry skin, the first thing you want to do is get rid of it ASAP. But have you ever given a thought to what really causes dry skin? There may be both internal and external factors that cause dry skin, and if you can control all of those, you may solve the issue without a good dry skincare routine. However, if not, in this article, we’ll plan a skincare routine for you and your dry skin, and by the end of the blog, you’ll be glowing, well, metaphorically. But first, let us look at the most common causes of Dry Skin. According to leading skincare experts, there can be several causes for dry skin. These causes can be medical and/or environmental, in simple words internal and external. The external factors are easier to get rid of in comparison to the internal factors. However, some of the internal factors too can be worked on. So let us learn more about these causes and how you can avoid them. The External Causes Environmental factors The environment that surrounds you is the cause of many changes in your body and skin. Now come on, that’s probably the whole reason we have climates, to test our durability. Just kidding! On a serious note, your body and skin go through several changes every time the seasons change, so look around and see if that's what’s causing your dry skin. Winter Dry skin in the winter is a common phenomenon. It happens because the dropping temperature and humidity levels sucking the moisture out in your skin. Another factor that could dry out your skin can be the excessive use of heat during winters. Hot and Dry Regions Dry skin problems are often found in people living in hot and dry climates like the deserts. During the summer, the moisture in your skin evaporates, which is what causes dry and dehydrated skin. This can be avoided by using external moisturizers and hydrating agents. Hard Water and Harsh Soaps Hard water can cause dry skin by clogging the pores in your skin. In addition, there are several minerals in hard water that react with soap to form salts that dry out your skin and make it flaky. So make sure you aren’t using hard water and harsh soaps for your skin, or at least for your face. Skin Irritants Exposure to numerous skin irritants can cause your skin to dry out real quick and cause other skin problems. So if you are exposed to skin irritants and chemical-based skin products, you might want to research whether whatever you are applying on your face is suitable for it or drying it out. The Internal Causes Well, certain medical and internal causes are not easy to control. However, some can be worked on. So let us find out a few internal reasons that are causing your dry skin. Genetics and Aging Well, if it is in your genes, you probably can’t do much about dry skin internally. But you can work on making it better by following a brilliant dry skincare routine. Another factor that causes dry skin is aging. As you get older, your skin produces less and less oil and collagen, causing it to become dry and wrinkly. Medical conditions and Deficiencies Certain medical conditions can cause dry skin. These conditions can be anything from hypothyroidism to psoriasis to diabetes. In addition, conditions like eczema, malnutrition, kidney failure, et cetera can also cause dry skin. A deficiency of vitamins B, C, and D can also cause dryness. However, we don’t want you to start popping vitamins randomly. It is always better to consult your doctor if you think you have vitamin deficiencies. And if you do, the doctor will prescribe supplements that can help produce more collagen and increase the moisture in your skin. So, finally, we are done with an overview of the possible causes of dry skin. Now let’s move on to the next step and help you create a daily dry skincare routine at home. Daily Dry Skincare Routine for Healthy Skin: Though there are several causes for dry skin, there are skin care practices that can help you hydrate and moisturize your skin. Here’s where we get to talking about the best skincare routine for dry skin. Cleanse your Skin The first and foremost thing you need to do is wash your face with a face wash that has hydrating ingredients. Make sure you use a soft cleanser that removes oil and dirt without disrupting the epidermis of your skin. A suggested face wash for your skin is the Hyaluronic & Ceramide Face Wash by Neemli Naturals . The product has Hyaluronic acid that hydrates your skin and removes germs and pollutants. It is specially created for sensitive skin to provide the moisture it needs and form a layer of protection against environmental aggressors. Use an Alcohol-Free Toner It is essential to use an alcohol-free toner after you rinse your face. Toners that have alcohol in them dry out your skin. Use a toner that refines your pores and restores your skin’s pH levels. Neemli’s Witch Hazel & Vetiver Pore Refining Facial Toner will be a great hydrating agent for your skin that can help clarify your skin gently, keeping your face smooth and supple. Use a Hydrating Serum When it comes to dry skin, it is important to use serums that repair, hydrate, and stimulate collagen in your skin to keep it hydrated and slow down the process of aging. With the Retinol & Peptide Serum , you can heal your skin and effectively combat hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles. Moisturize Regularly The Neemli Rose and Argan Day Cream works best to moisturize your skin. It has several moisturizing elements like Rose oil, Argan Oil, and Hyaluronic Acid. We know what you’re thinking, “Oh my God, that’s a day cream, what am I gonna do at night?”. Well, you can use the Hibiscus and saffron night cream for the night to make sure your dry skin repairs itself while you sleep in peace. So yeah, it is pretty essential to give your skin that double moisturizing dose to maintain the balance of your skin. Use a Hydrating Sunscreen Use a sunscreen that protects and hydrates your skin simultaneously. For example, with Neemli’s Natural SPF 30+ Mattifying Sunscreen , you can make sure you protect your skin from harmful UV rays and also moisturize it. So finally, here we are, at the end of the blog. You now know everything about the causes of dry skin and the best skincare routine for dry skin. Make sure you regularly follow the routine to keep your skin happy, hydrated, and healthy.

It’s almost like every big moment and occasion is marked with that dreaded pimple! While makeup helps, you should also be thinking about how to get rid of acne. We’re sure a lot of you would agree. Around 80% of people (Woah!) from the age group of 11 to 30 have acne-prone skin. So why do we get acne? This question bothers us, and in response, all we do is try lotions, cosmetics, and homemade remedies to get rid of acne without really understanding what our skin needs. But not anymore; in this blog, we will learn about the causes of acne and pimples . We will also share tips on the best skincare routine for acne-prone skin. What are the causes of acne? Let us find the root cause of acne first so that we can prevent it. If you already have pimples and acne, you need to know why it’s happening so you can treat it accordingly. Excessive oil production: Acne usually appears on your face, forehead, and upper back, where we have facial hair. Since facial hair follicles are connected to glands that produce oil, it causes acne and pimples. Also, if you use heavyweight lotions and creams excessively, it can make the acne on your skin worse. Hormonal changes: Boys and girls usually undergo hormonal changes during puberty. G irls particularly, experience fluctuating hormonal changes during menstruation or periods, which can lead to breakouts and pimples. Environmental factors: Pollution and the accumulation of dirt and grime is one of the primary causes of acne. Also, spikes in humidity can exacerbate your acne problem. Medication: Certain medicines contain a heavy dosage of corticosteroids, lithium, and androgenic steroids that ca n cause your acne to flare up. Stress: This is not one of the causes of acne, but if you already have acne, stress can definitely make it worse. Genetic effect: If anyone in your family has acne, your skin is likely to be acne-prone too. Regular skin care routine for acne-prone skin Have a balanced diet: Even though there is not enough research on foods that cause acne, it helps to eat a healthy diet with minimal refined sugars. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables, rich in Vitamin C and beta carotene can help reduce inflammation and consequently improve your acne. This is one of the simplest ways to add to your daily skincare routine for acne. Cleanse your face effectively : This goes without saying; cleansing (but not overwashing) your face is extremely important. Scrubbing too hard or often can damage your skin and make it dry. Find a cleanser that suits your skin type, use lukewarm to cool water, and let your face wash absorb fully before you wash it off. This is one of the best skincare routine steps to follow. Wash your face o nce in the morning and once before going to sleep. Also, remember the skin on your face is thinner than the skin on your body; be gentle and avoid applying harsh products on your face. Avoid picking acne and popping pimples: Many of us have the habit of picking a pimple and popping its impurities out. However, squeezing and bursting a pimple is a big no as the impurities may go deeper into your skin and make it worse. It can also cause blemishes and lead to scarring. Morning Skincare routine steps that your should follow Wash your face with a suitable face wash : As mentioned above, washing your face with a suitable face wash plays a vital role in keeping acne away. This is one of the most crucial steps when you’re trying to follow any of the best skincare routines for acne . Apply a toner : A toner will help you get rid of the excessive oil on your face and balance the pH levels of your skin. It’s a great idea for you to include a toner in your morning skincare routine for acne. Moisturize your skin : Whether you have dry or oily skin, you need to keep your skin hydrated. Even if your skin is oily, you can use an oil-free moisturizer that includes glycerin or hyaluronic acid. The Neemli Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer will help you control oil production and will hydrate your skin. Don’t skip sunscreen : This goes without saying - do not step out of your house without protecting your face from the harmful effects of the sun . You may be averse to using heavy, greasy sunscreen on your acne-prone skin. It is important to use a sunscreen that is light, non-comedogenic, offers broad-spectrum protection from UVA & UVB rays, and includes an SPF of 30 or more. Neemli Naturals Natural SPF 30++ Mattifying Broad Spectrum Sunscreen is water-resistant, sprayable, and protects your acne-prone skin effectively. Night Skincare routine steps Use a make-up remover : If you wear make-up, make sure you take it off before you go to bed. Make-up can clog your pores and not allow your skin to breathe, causing breakouts. Use a gentle makeup remover that has anti-inflammatory properties and will keep your skin away from irritation and acne. Wash your face : Regardless of how tired you are, you need to wash your face to keep it clean and keep acne away. It is a crucial step in any of the best skincare routines that you must follow. Apply the right skincare products : Use a night repair serum that is specially formulated for acne-prone skin. Salicylic acid is one of the most effective ingredients to treat acne because it has the ability to penetrate deep into the skin and pull out any excess dirt and sebum. The Neemli Naturals Glycolic & Salicylic Serum is ideal for acne-prone skin, combining glycolic acid - the AHA that exfoliates the upper layers of the skin with salicylic acid, the BHA that goes into the deeper layers of the skin to breakdown blockages. This serum alleviates clogged pores, blackheads, and acne while preventing future breakouts. An easy way to deal with acne pits and scars topically is to use a product formulated for that purpose. Neemli’s Glycolic Acid & Hydrolyzed Collagen Pit Repair Concentrate contains collagen-stimulating glycolic acid and regenerating hydrolyzed collagen that effectively targets acne pits, redness, and uneven skin texture to give you fresher, smoother, and more radiant skin. best skincare routine, morning skincare routine, night skincare routine, skin care routine steps Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

It's also vital to provide our bodies with some additional love and care. Arms, the back of our hands, legs, and occasionally shoulders are the most ignored parts of the body, and they suffer the most in the long term. During the winter, we tend to pay more attention to certain areas of the body. In general, the face and abdomen are extensively protected throughout our lives, which is why using specific body care products either once or twice a week, depending on the time, may transform the game in terms of how we feel about our skin. As for skincare enthusiasts, we are the first to scan through the latest facial product launches for hours on end. However, we can’t help but question why we devote so much attention to our faces while neglecting to consider the rest of our bodies. It's essential to understand how to properly care for your skin from head to toe and which skincare products will generate significant results. Continue reading further to know more about the best body care products. Benefits Of Using Body Care Products And Why It Is Important To Pamper Your Body The skin, as we all know, is our body's largest organ. As a result, we must naturally take care of it. On the other hand, our bodies do not require multi-step routines or maintenance when it comes to skincare . It just requires regular cleansing, exfoliating (weekly), moisturizing, and the occasional pampering massage. Brighten up your shower regimen with some extra body care products now and then. Of course, your body care routine does not have to be rigid, but you can set aside some time on a Sunday to follow one. Pick body care items that suit your skin type. Choosing your products thoughtfully and treating your body with the same respect as your face goes a long way physically and mentally. If you're thinking about starting a body care routine similar to your face, it's never too late. Begin by following Neemli Naturals' simple and hassle-free three-step Body Skincare routine. Choose from a variety of soaps, scrubs, body butter, and body oils from an extensive line of bath and body products . Each of these products is cruelty-free, organic, and environmentally friendly. Cleanse Exfoliate Moisturize Gentle Bathing cleanser: For an effective body skincare routine at home , the first thing we should look for in a body cleanser is moisturizing properties, such as shea butter, essential oils such as Olive oil, Multani clay, and so on. The harsh chemicals in our body wash, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, fragrances, and colours, are often overlooked. Not only are these chemicals damaging to the skin, but they are also harmful to the ecosystem. Even individuals with sensitive skin will benefit from Neemli's Gentle bathing bar. This bar is ideal for sensitive and oily skin since it is created with revitalizing French Pink Clay and cleansing Multani Clay. It clarifies skin and balances excessive oil production, leaving you with smooth, clear skin. Exfoliate: Walnut is the most common ingredient in a classic exfoliating body scrub, which can be harmful to the skin because of its abrasive texture that causes tiny tears in the skin. One of the best body care tips is that you can try an organic coffee scrub instead of a walnut scrub. It revitalizes your skin by removing dead skin cells, blackheads, and other impurities. The scrub, which is made with antioxidant-rich coffee, aids in effective exfoliation, improved circulation, and skin tightening, The scrub's caffeine component also helps to reduce the appearance of cellulite and stretch marks. This scrub exfoliates and stimulates the skin while helping it retain moisture and stay nourished. It's made with vitamin-rich, moisturizing Grape Seed, Coconut, and Olive Oils. Moisturize: Moisturizers or body care creams should be used immediately after a shower to keep your skin moisturized and supple for a longer period during the day. Choose body care creams/body butter/body oils with skin-loving ingredients that nourish the skin and have healing properties in them. The Neemli Naturals body butter with Kokum and Tamarind fits the bill perfectly. This body butter is light on the skin while providing an intense dose of moisture and hydration. It is also loaded with nourishing ingredients like Vitamin E and niacinamide which boost collagen production and improve skin elasticity. It also aids in skin protection. You will notice a significant improvement in your skin if you use body care products daily. Along with this body care routine do not forget to wear sunscreen to protect your skin from the harmful UV rays. You can also read about the benefits of using sunscreen here.

Gone are the days when SKINCARE was primarily linked with women. ‘ A good skincare routine for men’ is not an unheard-of phrase anymore. Skincare has evolved over the years. With the rise in popularity of skincare on a global scale, an increasing number of individuals are adopting new skincare trends. This blog is for anyone who is curious about what it means and what it takes to have a skincare routine but doesn't know where to start. Men’s skin is, without a doubt, different from women’s. Apart from physical differences, men, in general, have thicker skin than women. They also have larger pores and generate more sebum. Hormones, geography, climate, dietary choices, water intake, stress, and cigarette and alcohol consumption are all related to this. Acne, wrinkles, and UV damage can all be caused by a combination of these factors. A proper skincare routine for men may make a significant difference in how good and confident they feel. Skincare for men cannot be viewed as just washing one's face in the morning anymore. Men are notoriously sluggish when it comes to washing their faces before bed (you know it's true), so they can't possibly follow a detailed skincare routine for men . With a few tips, however, they can address numerous problems and keep that skin looking fresh and young. What are the Best Skincare Tips for Men? Each skin type is unique. Dry, normal, and oily skin types are the most prevalent. However, men may have a specific skin concern that they would like to address. This relates to particular skin conditions such as wrinkles, acne, hyperpigmentation, redness, and inflammation. A lot of the time, products are created to answer a specific need. Skincare is not inexpensive. The skincare industry is so crowded with options that it may be overwhelming at times. It might be expensive to test out ten various products to find what works best for you. Deciding where to begin may be difficult. But you don't need anything else to make you feel stressed out. You can begin with a very basic regimen. At the very least, the CTM approach (cleansing, toning, and moisturizing) should be followed for men's skincare. It might be the perfect time to begin a new habit and make it work for you. The complete skincare routine for men should have 5 basic steps Cleansing Toning Eye Cream Masking (once a week) Moisturiser When it comes to men's skincare , there are a few ingredients that are used more frequently than others. Among these ingredients is charcoal. You might wonder why. Because it offers a plethora of skin-beneficial properties! Charcoal for men's skin has become one of the most popular ways of skin treatment for guys. Used medically for thousands of years, charcoal absorbs germs, toxins, and dirt effectively, leaving skin clear and healthy. It also acts as a natural deodorant, detoxifies, and prevents acne. Want to know how to start a skincare routine for men ? Start by including Neemli’s selection of charcoal-activated products in a regular skin care regimen. Activated Charcoal Detox Bathing Bar Ideally, skincare for men should start in their 20’s. Men can keep their skin looking young and fresh for years to come by following a simple yet efficient skincare routine . Guys must try their hands on the Neemli Naturals charcoal detox bathing bar that uses activated charcoal, a critical ingredient in Ayurveda known for its absorption and cleansing properties along with rhassoul clay with soothing properties that help nourish skin and curtail excessive oil production. Enriched with tea tree oil and lavender essential oil, this bar effectively fights acne with its antifungal and antimicrobial properties and packs in antioxidants that support skin health. Regardless of whether you shave or not, start your face care regimen by washing your face to eliminate any pollutants, grime, and regulate your sebum levels. Use a face cleanser twice a day to keep your skin clean (morning and night). Excessive face-washing can strip your skin of its natural oils. Sweat, oil, and germs may clog pores during exercise, thus activated charcoal is an excellent addition to any skincare routine for men who work out . Sweat can also cause acne. Benefits : good for daily use, great for oily and acne-prone skin, minimizes oil production and breakouts.

The Neemli Caffeine and Cucumber Under Eye Cream is formulated with energizing caffeine and hydrating cucumber seed oil to target the region’s stubbornness and leave it looking bright, fresh, and smooth. The eye cream may be used after a long day at work, after a night of partying with colleagues, or just to avoid dark circles.

Getting dressed, grabbing a bite to eat, and rushing out the door, or opening the laptop to start working from home to begin the day due to the pandemic, is a regular phenomenon. Amidst all this confusion Completing your morning skincare routine may be tough , but should not be skipped. While night time skincare is essential, morning skincare is just as important. Our skin goes through a lot each day, thanks to pollution, sweat, and sun exposure, so it's vital to take the time to prepare and shield it for what's to come. Significance of Morning Skincare Routine A morning skincare routine should be effective. We live in a world of options when it comes to beauty and skincare. However, skincare is always a personal choice: Whether you're dealing with breakouts and sensitive skin, extreme dryness and acne, or any of several other irritating combinations, finding the right product mix may be difficult. It can also be completely overwhelming! Taking care of oneself should no longer be viewed as a luxury or even an indulgence. It's a requirement now, more than ever, for a variety of reasons. Although there is no such thing as a \"perfect\" skin-care routine, there is an ideal technique to apply your products. Whether you're a minimalist who enjoys a three-step regimen or someone ready to go through 11 stages every day in the quest for flawless skin, the way you apply your products significantly influences how well they perform. The more product-intensive the order grows, the more essential it becomes. The most important thing to remember about a good skincare routine is to layer your products right to optimize the benefits of the product. It should not nullify the benefits of other products. Let us be honest: nobody has the time to have a detailed beauty routine during office rush hours . So, if you are unsure about building a skincare routine, your search ends here with Neemli Naturals . We have products designed to suit every skin type because not all skin types are the same. Formulations used in all our products are cruelty-free, vegan, and most importantly, effective. Look no further - we will help you nail a minimalist daily morning skincare routine. The Best Order To Layer Skincare Products in the morning with Neemli Naturals Cleanser Toner Serum Moisturizer Sunscreen Start With A Cleanser: Start your mornings by cleansing your face Use a non-oily cleanser to thoroughly wash your face and remove any leftover dirt and grime that may be collected on your pillow during your beauty sleep. Hyaluronic & Ceramide Face Wash is an excellent choice for dry skin Specifically formulated for sensitive skin, t it hydrates through the day while also building a protective barrier to defend against environmental aggressors and locking in moisture. Thanks to skin-replenishing ceramides and moisturizing hyaluronic acid, it leaves your face feeling smooth, moisturized, and plump. For oily/acne-prone skin , Tea tree and Salicylic face wash is designed to reduce breakouts without depleting the skin of its natural oils. Tea tree oil, with its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, reduces sebum production and battles acne, while salicylic acid deep cleans the skin, removing germs and preventing new breakouts. This face wash is also packed with exfoliating glycolic acid and soothing aloe vera, leaving skin feeling fresh, moisturized, and clear. Use A Toner: Toners shrink the appearance of large pores. and remove any last traces of dirt, grime, and impurities that block them. Those with oily, acne-prone skin should look for toners like the Neemli Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid & Apple Cider Vinegar, which maintains the pH level of the skin. It acts like a double cleanser. The toner's ingredients include Aloe vera, which has soothing effects, making it an excellent skincare product for retexturizing the skin and adding radiance. Those with dry skin must try their hands on the Witch Hazel & Vetiver Pore Refining Facial Toner as this toner keeps your face smooth and supple without drying it out. Serum: Adding a serum to your daily skincare routine is important because serums have active ingredients in them. For the daytime, choose serums with antioxidant properties that protect the skin from harmful UV rays and pollution. The most common is vitamin C that helps boost collagen production while preventing the appearance of dull patches and dark spots. This is exactly what a Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serum provides. This serum, which is full of skin-loving ingredients, has a non-greasy composition and a gel-like texture due to aloe leaf extract, acts as a silky makeup primer, and brightens your face considerably. Moisturize Well: Moisturizing is an important part of any skincare routine . Using the right moisturizer helps to restore skin balance. If your skin is oily, we recommend you look for a light, non-comedogenic moisturizer, instead of heavy creams. Neemli’s Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturiser when used after a shower helps to retain moisture in the skin, leaving it smooth and supple all day. If your skin is prone to dryness, opt for a light cream with greater oil content like Argan and Rose Day Cream which is ideal for nourishing and protecting your skin against environmental elements as part of your regular skin hydration routine. Well moisturized skin is healthy, defies signs of aging, and has a soft, radiant glow. Use Sunscreen - When it comes to a healthy morning skincare routine, our top tip is -DO NOT SKIP THE SUNSCREEN ! It is the simplest and most effective way to protect your skin and maintain a healthy texture and tone at any age. T he Neemli Natural SPF 30+ Mattifying Sunscreen is a non-sticky broad-spectrum sunscreen that is suitable for all skin types and protects against sun damage while hydrating skin and minimizing pigmentation. Conclusion This minimalist and effective morning skincare routine will not only help you start off your day well (yes, it’s therapeutic once you’re invested), but your skin will definitely thank you.

Follow these tips religiously for 3 months along with your daily skincare routine, and that elusive bridal glow will be yours. Include these 8 tips in your daily skincare routine: Adopt double cleansing for your night routine With the degree of pollution and dirt your skin is exposed to day in and day out, maintaining healthy and glowing skin requires a little extra effort. Cleansing is a crucial step of your daily skincare routine, but now is the time to step it up. Adopt the smart habit of double cleansing your face every night. However effective your cleanser is, it’s not a makeup remover. However, using a good makeup remover will make all the difference in achieving healthy and nourished skin for your big day. Choose a makeup remover with natural butter and oils. It works as a dual agent - cleansing your skin while hydrating and softening it. Expert Advice: Use a natural oil-based makeup remover as it not only cleanses your pores gently but leaves your skin hydrated and nourished. Try our Rice Water & Hemp Seed Oil Makeup Remover for invigorated and radiant bridal skin. The rice water cleanses your pores, while the hemp seed oil nourishes and softens the skin. 2 . Include hyaluronic acid products in your skincare routine It’s no secret that well-hydrated skin exudes radiance. But what people may not know is that Hyaluronic acid helps lock moisture into your skin, keeping it hydrated and radiant for a longer time. Hyaluronic acid helps in reducing wrinkles and redness of the skin, giving you perfectly luminous skin for your special day. In the months leading up to your wedding, include at least one hyaluronic acid-laden product in your daily skincare routine to get that splendid bridal glow. Don’t skip this tip; this one product will bump up your bridal daily skincare routine. Check out our Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturiser (10ml) for hydrated, plump, and youthful skin. 3 . Exfoliate and follow up with a Brightening serum We often overlook the effectiveness of exfoliation as excessive exfoliation usually leaves your skin dry and itchy. But done right, this step can boost your skin quality significantly. Regular exfoliation removes dead cells to enhance radiance and can improve the absorption of skin brightening products, helping you achieve a healthy, glowing complexion faster. To take your skincare routine a step further, pair exfoliation with our brightening Turmeric Root & Olive Squalane Elixir . It will help you achieve a luminous bridal glow from within. Brides-to-be with oily skin, check out the Neemli30 GLOW UP KIT FOR OILY SKIN . An entire routine curated especially to restore skin glow, this bundle brings together a medley of skin-loving ingredients that give your dull skin the glow-up it deserves! 4 . Deep Clean with a mask Time for a myth buster: A mask is never meant to be a substitute for your cleansing routine. It’s only meant to amplify it. Our skin has many layers; a face wash cleanses the uppermost layer, but what about the impurities inhabiting the deeper layers? A mask goes deeper into your skin and melts out the hard sebum in your pores. Every week, deep cleaning your skin with a mask may just be the special push your skincare routine needs before your big day. If you have dry skin , use a mask once or twice a month. But if you have oily skin , apply a mask every week to keep your skin oil and dirt free. Our Activated Charcoal Detox Face Mask is perfect for a light pre-bridal cleanse, giving you soft, refreshed, and blemish-free skin. Include Retinol in your daily skincare routine If you don’t include retinol in your daily skincare routine from your mid-20s, you miss out on a great skin emollient. Retinol, derived from vitamin A, increases cell turnover, unclogs pores, boosts collagen production, and helps diminish hyperpigmentation. Its anti-aging properties help improve the tone and texture of your skin. Incorporate our Retinol & Peptide Serum (5ml) in your daily skincare routine. Ease into this treatment by applying this 2-3 times a week and gradually build to daily use. Sweat it out Don’t sweat it, just sweat! Sweating is the best way to get a natural, illuminating glow. When you sweat, it flushes out toxins and impurities from your skin, improving your skin’s tone, clarity, and texture. When you exercise, your blood circulation increases, bringing nutrient-rich blood to the surface. Sweating will help your skin detoxify and give you a post-workout glow you can’t resist falling in love with. Get plenty of good quality sleep If the threat of unsightly dark circles is not enough for you to work on getting a good 8-10 hours of sleep, how about the fact that, when you sleep, your skin cells regenerate and recover from the day’s exhaustion giving you a refreshed and rested look in the morning? Good REM-rich sleep helps you get skin that will outshine even the most candescent wedding decorations. Expert Advice : Apply the super effective Neemli Caffeine & Cucumber Under Eye Cream l to diminish those dark circles.

You've come to the right place. Your skin, just like you, requires some me-time. It deserves some TLC after a hard day at work. Increased stress, inconsistent sleep patterns, and poor eating habits can have detrimental effects on your skin. So, after a hard and exhausting day at work, here's how you can pamper your skin and show it some love. Considering that skin is the largest organ in our bodies, it becomes imperative for all of us to take care of it. For these reasons, skincare is an indispensable part of our daily routine. Have you ever wondered how to achieve beautiful skin at home? An excellent skincare tip we'd like to share, it's time to improve your CTM (Cleansing, Toning, Moisturising) skincare regimen, which will enhance your natural beauty. It might be advantageous in the long run. It's no longer a distant dream to have healthy, blemish-free, and acne-free skin. Here are some fantastic skincare tips to help you get the radiance you've always desired. In this blog, we will discuss all that you need is a basic understanding of your skin and its dos and donts . You can use these tips to get naturally glowing skin at home. Include these skincare tips in your daily routine for a more effective regimen. Just like dressing up according to your body type can transform your fashion game, customizing your skincare according to your skin type can make a lot of difference to your skincare routine . While the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach can be applied to certain aspects of life, it does not apply to skincare. This is because various products, environments, and even food react differently to different skin types. It is essential to use products that are specifically designed for each skin type. There are different skin types: normal, dry, oily, acne-prone , and combination. Regardless of your skin type, here are some Skin Care Tips to follow to get naturally beautiful skin at home. 6 Skincare Mistakes That You Need To Avoid DON'T Forget To Take Off Your Makeup First skincare tip we recommend is to never sleep with makeup on. The most important part of a good skincare routine is taking off your makeup and letting the skin breathe. Always (and we mean always) take off your makeup before retiring to your bed. Your skin needs to breathe - especially at night. And makeup stops this from happening. Leaving it on overnight clogs pores, which may lead to pimples and blackheads. Neemli’s Rice Water & Hemp Seed Oil Makeup Remover has gentle ingredients that clean the skin without stripping its natural oils. It eliminates all makeup residue leaving your skin soft and plump. DON’T Skip Sunscreen: Fun (or not so fun) fact - the sun and the skin don't get along too well. We recommend using Sunscreen both indoors and outdoors . Yes, wearing sunscreen inside the house is necessary since damaging UV rays might enter through an open window. Our Natural SPF 30+ Mattifying Broad Spectrum Sunscreen is a fast-absorbing, non-pore-blocking, water-resistant sun protector that offers safe and long-lasting UVA and UVB protection. DON’T Miss Out On Moisturizer: You must have heard this - never skip moisturizer, regardless of your skin type. Well, it’s true! Remember that moisturized skin is healthy skin! You don't need a heavy moisturizer; a light formula like Neemli Hyaluronic & Oat Amino Acid Moisturizer can help control oil production and keep your skin hydrated, plump, and youthful. The right moisturizer can be beneficial in restoring the skin's compromised moisture barrier while also hydrating it. When used right after a shower, Hyaluronic acid works like a sponge, restoring moisture into the skin. This aids in the softening of fine lines and the firming of the skin, as well as the smoothing out of dry, rough spots. DON’T Forget to Exfoliate : If your face appears dull and worn, there are a few things you can do. Instead of using regular physical exfoliators, we recommend adding an exfoliating toner to your everyday skincare routine Glycolic Acid is the star ingredient in Neemli Glycolic Acid & Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner which has the unique ability to penetrate deeper into the skin, effectively exfoliating the top layers of the skin to promote skin cell regeneration. Apple Cider Vinegar is a natural astringent that helps improve blood flow to the skin, reducing the appearance of pores. DON’T Skip Your Vitamins: While a well-balanced diet is essential, there are other ways to provide vitamins to your skin. Applying vitamin C to the face is just as vital as consuming foods high in proteins and vitamins. Make Vitamin C your best friend . Our hyaluronic and Vitamin C serum that works well for all skin types should be used immediately after cleansing to allow your skin to absorb it thoroughly, and it can also be applied under sunscreen for added protection. It is a non-greasy gel-based serum that can be used daily to help your skin retain moisture. DON’T Wash Your Face With Hot Water: Hot water generally tends to make your skin dry. Facial skin must be treated very gently. The best skincare tip is to avoid using hot water on the face as it strips away its natural oils. Lukewarm water must be used to wash your face. Begin your day by cleansing your skin with a mild face wash. We advise you to use Tea tree and Salicylic Face Wash which is ideal for oily/combination skin. It cleans and hydrates the skin without drying it out. Hyaluronic & Ceramide Face Wash is a wonderful choice to add to your daily skincare routine if you have dry skin. This composition is designed specifically for dry and sensitive skin types, and it keeps the skin looking fresh and moisturized all day. Now let's concentrate on some DOs to get great results for beautiful skin at home naturally Indulge in some Natural Skincare Tips to follow at home DO Exercise: It is important to exercise regularly. Exercising daily promotes blood circulation in the body. After working out, you will notice a glow on your face. We also advise you not to skip your post-workout skin care routine . At the very least, wash your face before leaving the gym to remove all the filth and grime brought on by the perspiration. To keep the moisture in your skin, use a gentle face wash followed by a light moisturizer. This can be a great skincare tip to keep your skin looking radiant and healthy. Do Sleep On A Fresh Pillow Case: Your pillowcase accumulates oil, grime, and perspiration over time. This is potentially damaging to your skin. Changing your pillowcase is important to avoid dust and dirt and should be done frequently. A clean pillowcase will help you avoid bacteria and other things that might clog your pores. DO Sleep Better: A minimum of six to eight hours of sleep is required. The body heals itself during sleep. Sleep deprivation causes puffy under-eye circles, which are unappealing to the eye. Don’t worry we have got you covered you can use our Under eye cream with cucumber and caffeine to soothe those baggy eyes. Just scoop a small amount and apply gentle pressure with your ring finger and apply it lightly around your eye area. This step can be followed after cleanser, toner, and serum. Follow these Do-it-yourself skincare tips at home to get bright and clear skin DO IT Yourself Skincare: Return to your origins when it comes to skincare. Make DIY a part of your regular skincare routine. Don't forget about the basics. Chickpea and turmeric face packs are excellent for glowing skin. For puffy or under-eye dark circles, cucumbers and tea bags can be used. Rosewater and aloe vera are excellent toners that also help to tighten the skin. For black spots and pimples, DIY hacks like lemon juice and toothpaste are frequently used. Some even say that home remedies are their secret to naturally glowing skin. If there’s one skincare tip that we can give for DIYs, it’s to be mindful about the shelf-life as these aren’t meant to be stored. They may not only lose their efficacy but also turn rancid. Our skincare range is scientifically proven, tailored to each skin type, cruelty-free, and most importantly, safe. Instead of wasting money on expensive treatments at beauty salons, we recommend investing in a line of products that will give you bright, clean skin at home. Takeaway Simplify your daily routine with these skincare tips for youthful, beautiful skin with only a few simple steps and products. Focus on one area at a time, check what works best for you, and skip the rest. Focus on discovering more about your skin type. When you get to know your skin, you can figure out the ideal skincare routine for getting flawless skin without having to spend extra money on outcomes that don't make you feel attractive. Frequently Asked Questions How can I get Spotless skin in 2 days?

Whatever the case may be, the end objective is to have healthy, attractive hair. We've compiled a collection of the best hair care tips according to every season in this blog to make your life simpler. Your life can never be perfect, but your hair can. A nice hair day may often lift your spirits. It turns out that having a nice hair day may significantly boost your confidence. It's an essential aspect of your appearance that sets the tone for the rest of your ensemble. A poor hair day is nothing more than a bad day. Every season brings new challenges for your hair so it’s imperative that we customize our hair care regimen with every changing season. Hair loss and frizz are fairly frequent concerns throughout the year. Aside from hair loss, there are a few other typical hair issues that people face throughout the year. Dandruff Split ends Dry hair Frizzy hair Dull hair Color damaged hair To combat all these issues you can also choose to massage your scalp with hair oil since this is believed to enhance blood circulation. Oiling hair has a number of advantages, one of which is that it promotes hair growth. A good old hair massage may also help you relax and reduce stress levels. Hair oiling on a regular basis keeps your scalp nourished and moisturized. The hair oil penetrates deep into your scalp, strengthening the hair roots and resulting in thicker, shinier hair. Hair oiling, while not as necessary as shampooing and cleaning your hair for healthy hair development, is still an important element of your daily hair care routine since it improves overall hair health. Apart from hair oiling, finding the right products that actually work is a task, but don’t worry, we have done the hard work for you - here is a hair care regimen that works. Keep your hair healthy and safe as the seasons change with these hair care tips : Necessary Hair Care Tips for summer As you welcome summer with wide arms, make sure to adjust your skincare and haircare routine to ensure that you look your best throughout the hot, bright days. Use these summer hair tips and methods to take care of your beautiful strands. Invest in a moisturizing shampoo that will not rob your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry and brittle. Wash your hair a minimum of two times a week to get rid of dirt and grime accumulated on your scalp. Use a moisturizing conditioner to add moisture and nourishment to your tresses. This is especially crucial in the summer since hot, bright days cause your hair to dry out. After you wash and condition, apply a moisturizing hair mask to your locks and let it stay on for 4 to 5 minutes. Use cold water to rinse it. For the best results, apply it to the ends. This is a step that many people overlook. It can help your hair in a variety of ways, including adding shine and controlling frizz. Look for a hair serum that is appropriate for your hair type. After washing your hair, use a serum or leave-in conditioner. Use a little quantity on clean, wet hair and avoid the roots for the best results. Some bonus hair care tips for hot weather: while traveling, wrap your hair with a scarf to protect it from severe heat. While out in the sun, you can also take an umbrella or wear a hat. Essential Haircare tips for monsoon After a long, scorching summer, the rain arrives. It is well known that the monsoon season may cause hair damage owing to the sticky atmosphere caused by high humidity. This raises the likelihood of dandruff, hair loss, and other issues. In fact, your hair is at its most vulnerable at this period, and it requires extra care or special attention. Show your hair tonnes of love after summer with these hair care tips to keep your hair issues to a minimum. Given that we are always on the go, there is no way of avoiding getting wet in the rain. Shampoo your hair with a clarifying or anti residue shampoo on a regular basis to wash off any residue or particles left on your scalp by rain. You should wash your hair at least once a week. Because monsoon tends to make hair limp, use an anti-frizz conditioner. To avoid this, use a liberal amount of conditioner from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair to calm the frizzy hair. In the rain, a detangler spray is useful. Spray a few pumps of it from afar using a wide-toothed comb. It will help reduce hair breakage. Apart from keeping the hair and scalp clean during monsoon, it is important to trim your hair on a daily basis. Trimming and cutting your hair will not only give you a new look but will also help you get rid of split ends and dryness. How To Take Care of Your Hair In Winters? Have you ever wondered how the cold affects your hair? We've got you covered if winter is pulling your hair care game down. Cold winds and low temperatures can be brutal to your hair. Here is a list of tips that will help you take care of your hair in winter. Dandruff is a common issue in the winter because of which you may experience a flaky scalp. This is due to the fact that the winter causes our scalp to become dry and sensitive. Because static clogs the hair, use an anti-dandruff or volumizing shampoo. The dry air of winter may strip moisture from your hair and cause the cuticle to open resulting in split ends. To prevent your hair from becoming frizzy and unruly, apply a deep hair conditioning hair masque. Aside from this regular hair care regimen, we'd like to provide some extra hair care tips to help you maintain your hair. We recommend washing your hair less during the winter because there is no perspiration. Excessive shampooing is the cause of dry, flaky scalp throughout the winter. Shampoos remove the natural oils from your scalp, leaving your hair dry. Avoid heat-styling your hair too much. In the winter, minimize heat styling your hair and go for cool hairstyles like braids, buns, updos, and twists. If you must style, limit your exposure to the equipment and apply a heat protectant serum. Natural Hair Care tips at home to maintain healthy hair. Let's look at some DIY hair treatments that will help you achieve commercial-ready hair now that you know what products to use or not use in each season. With simple natural hair care tips, you can finally match your trending Pinterest board for glossy hair. Egg + Lemon + Yogurt Mask Eggs have a number of hair-nourishing qualities. By combining yogurt, eggs, and a teaspoon of lemon, you can make a quick hair mask. Lemon not only covers the unpleasant odor of the combination, but it also gives your hair the vitamins it needs. Avocado+Coconut Oil Use half an avocado. (Eat a slice or two) and blend the rest with coconut oil or honey to provide your hair with the extra nutrients it requires. Apply it to your hair, leave it on for an hour, and then rinse it out with a gentle shampoo. That's it, you can have silky hair in no time so you won't need to go to the salon all the time. You can use anything you have on hand, like bananas, honey, and eggs, to make an at-home mask the next time you need to rejuvenate your locks. Here is a list of Products to use in order to keep your hair clean It's essential to have a solid hair care routine if you want to keep your hair healthy. Regardless of which hair care tips you apply, the products you use will make a difference at the end of the day. Because each product is meant to address a unique need, it's critical that you utilize products tailored to your hair type. Neemli Naturals Rosemary & Jojoba Hair Oil : Elders have always emphasized the importance of hair oiling. Oiling your hair is necessary for any season to strengthen the roots and minimize hair fall. This hair oil can be a fantastic addition to your hair care routine because of its lightweight formula. This is also appropriate for all hair types. Apply it to your hair strands or to your scalp. To achieve the best results, keep it on for an hour and then wash it off with a mild shampoo. Use moisturizing shampoo on dry or brittle hair. If you have an oily scalp, use a light, clarifying shampoo that won't deplete your hair of its natural oils. Chemicals can irritate your scalp and cause itching. Use a shampoo that is free of parabens, sulfates, and SLS. Fragrance-laden shampoos and conditioners are other items to avoid. Before purchasing hair products, read the label. It's never stated what exactly is in the products to give them such a lovely scent. You should also limit the use of silicone-based hair products. Silicones will weigh the hair down, and since it seals the hair cuticles from outside, it stops the hair shaft from entering and dries up your hair overtime. Instead, choose conditioner and shampoos that have natural oils like Moroccan argan oil, cold-pressed coconut oil that will nourish your hair over time. FAQ’s What Should I Eat for Thick Hair? There are few products you can consume for thick hair. Eat superfoods that are rich in protein, omega 3, and fatty acids like eggs, walnuts, avocados, and sweet potatoes that will help you have longer and thicker hair. Why is coconut oil bad for your hair? Coconut oil has the potential to block the pores of the roots, attracting additional dust. It's also thicker, which requires repeated washing, which isn't ideal. Instead, try our lightweight Rosemary & Jojoba Hair Oil, which locks in moisture and makes your hair silky, and shiny. Wrapping up We hope that by following all of the above hair care tips , you will achieve your soft, lustrous, and healthy hair goals. Create a regimen that works for you and experience healthy hair!

A daily skincare routine of cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen is vital for skin health, but skin damage can persist even with a good skincare routine. Unfair, isn’t it? If, despite following a skincare routine, your skin is cracked, red, or prone to frequent acne breakouts, take it as your skin’s way of telling you that it needs something more. While a cleanser is responsible for keeping your face clean, the toner makes sure your skin is receptible to all the nutrients you provide for it. But a face cream does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to providing all the nutrients and hydration your skin needs. So choosing a face cream that works and provides the love and care your skin needs is extremely important. Best Face Cream Ingredients For Glowing and Healthy Skin Every now and then, there comes a wave of skincare ingredient popularity that unleashes a wild demand for skincare products starring those ingredients. But that wave often dies as fast as it rises. However, every once in a while, we stumble upon a keeper. Special mention to our beloved vitamin C , proudly leading the ingredient-driven skincare industry of face cream for women. Amino Acids If you have ever attended a biology lecture in school, you would know that amino acids are the building blocks that create protein and are an integral part of almost all body systems. That means they are critically responsible for anything that happens on the skin level, too. Interesting! Amino acids are what bricks are to a house. Without them, your skin is defenseless against environmental aggressors. So when you go out to buy a face cream for glowing skin , remember that healthy skin is the stepping stone for glowing skin. Benefits of amino acid in face creams. Hydrates the skin All our dreaded skin problems like excessive oil production, dryness, and acne breakouts stem from this one problem, the lack of hydration. We try so many different moisturizers hoping that they will help lock the moisture into our skin, giving us hydrated and supple skin. So, we are trying to fix an internal problem with a superficial solution, these hydrators can help lock moisture for some hours, but they don’t hydrate your skin from within. So the issue is just covered, not fixed. Even the so-called best face creams for women fail to hydrate the deeper layers of our skin. Whereas, Amino acid pushes the moisture through and into our skin, thereby hydrating it from within. Hydrated skin is resistant to frequent acne breakouts, dry and dull-looking skin. Hence, you must choose a face cream for daily use that not just moisturizes your skin but, more importantly, hydrates it internally. Builds Collagen One of the essential functions of a face cream is to strengthen the skin tissue and increase skin elasticity. Collagen is responsible for improving skin elasticity and stretch. There is a plethora of face creams for women available, including synthetic collagen that helps prevent wrinkles and fine lines. It would have been magical if that worked, but sadly that's not how either face cream or collagen works. Our collagen-producing skin cannot absorb this collagen, but guess what it does absorb? Amino acids, and that too, quite easily. The relatively smaller size of amino acids allows the skin to absorb them readily. Thus, amino acids are a crucial part of the process of creating collagen. So isn’t it wiser to choose a face cream for daily use with amino acids rather than collagen in the ingredients list? Do that, and your skin will start feeling smoother and firmer in just a few weeks. Whoa! Now, that's some valuable bit of information. Accelerates healing Perhaps the most remarkable quality of amino acids is their ability to heal damaged skin and decelerate tissue breakdown. The most frequent complaint that men and women have about their skincare products is their inability to initiate improvement in their skin quality. As long as we apply the products, we enjoy the benefits, but our skin goes back to its usual condition once we stop using them. The reason being that these skincare products solely focus on treating our skincare problems, but they fall short in healing them. On the other hand, amino acids play a vital role in increasing cell turnover (remove dead skin cells and regenerate new cells in their place) and heal acne scarring. After you cleanse and tone your skin, your face needs an emollient that not only feels soothing but works tirelessly behind the screens to help you achieve healthy and glowing skin from deep within. Find a face cream with amino acids that suits your skin, and you have hit the jackpot. Argan oil Argan oil has undeniable success in the hair and skincare sphere. Extracted from the fruit kernels of argan trees found in Morocco, argan oil is a nutrient-dense gem you must not miss out on. Traditionally it was referred to as liquid gold for its many medical, culinary, and skincare benefits. Whether it’s a face cream for women or men, brands have often highlighted Argan oil for all its glorious benefits. And for once, they aren’t overselling - this super-rich source of fatty acids and vitamin E does live up to the hype. See for yourself! Benefits of Argan Oil Scar Treatment Scars are the manifestation of an issue our skin is fighting on its own; it’s a cue for us to bring in super ingredients into our face care regimen. What better than the Moroccan liquid gold itself? The healing powers of Argan oil have been utilized by the local tribes of Morocco for centuries. The omnipotent antioxidant properties of Argan oil can help prevent scarring by regenerating new cells. It also deals with hyperpigmentation and scarring, giving you healthy and scar-free skin. Acne healer Even though it’s an oil, the non-comedogenic properties make it a great ingredient for acne-prone skin. It’s super light on the skin and doesn't clog pores. It’s perfect as an ingredient in a face cream for daily use. If you have acne-prone oily skin, here’s an effective daily skincare routine specially curated for you.

We are here to help you create the best lip care routine to get soft and supple lips. When people speak of lip care, all they mention is the importance of using a good lip balm. What is the best lip balm for dry lips? Which lip balm works faster, and what flavor is better? That's all that's ever discussed on lip care. Lip care is an essential part of our skincare routine, yet we have hardly explored it beyond the surface. Do you know any other lip care product other than the customary lip balm? Did you know massaging your lips daily with natural oil helps in getting pink lips faster? Many people don’t know about these facts. But that's about to change because you are here, and we are about to learn everything there is to know about dry lips, lip care routines, and the best lip care products. First things first, to create the perfect lip care routine to get rid of chapped lips, we need to understand why our lips go dry. Let’s find out: Why do we get dry lips? To solve a problem, we first need to understand what is causing it. For example, the main reason behind dry lips is the lack of oil-producing sebaceous glands. With the absence of oil-producing glands, once our lips dry out, they have no mechanism to deal with it. So before we discuss the ways to heal chapped lips, let’s focus on the causes of dry lips: Dehydration It seems drinking enough water is the solution to all our problems. For example, dry lips are a sign of dehydration; hence drinking water , eating fruits, and cutting down on caffeinated drinks is the best way to heal dry and cracked lips. Water is the magic ingredient that gives life to your dry, chapped lips. Exposure Unlike our skin, lips can’t create the sun-filtering natural melanin, which means it’s completely defenseless against the damaging effects of environmental stressors. When you step out without a UV-protected lip balm or lipstick, your lips are exposed to an array of hazardous pollutants and stressors, leading them to dry out. Licking your lips: Many people have a habit of licking their lips to get rid of dryness. It feels great at that moment, like a thirst being quenched. Doesn't it? But it’s time you face the music; every time you lick your lips, you are coating your lips with bacteria whose sole job is to break food down. And when it comes in contact with your lips, it breaks down the skin around your lips, giving you dry lips. What’s the alternative? It’s pretty simple. Just take a sip of water every time you get an urge to lick your lips. The simple things are often the best things in life. Nutrient Deficiencies: If your lip care routine doesn't work despite your continued efforts, chances are your lips are lacking essential nutrients. Just like every other body part, your lips need certain nutrients to stay healthy. Vitamin A, C, E, and Zinc are essential for healthy pink lips. If your daily diet doesn't include food rich in these nutrients, chances are you will suffer from dry lips. Ingredients to avoid in your lip care routine The skin on our lips is susceptible; it becomes an arduous task to restore it to its original condition once damaged. In the case of lip care, prevention is a thousand times better than the cure. Therefore, before we learn about the best lip care routine, it’s wiser to first understand the common fallacies that people fall prey to in their lip care approach to avoid it. Parabens There’s a reason people nowadays are swarming towards natural lip care products. Chemical preservatives like parabens are hazardous to not just our lip health but also to our endocrine system. Many lip care products contain parabens, be wary of it. Artificial flavors How bad are artificial flavors? Bad enough to leave you with irreversible damage. If you want soft and smooth lips, then it’s safe to say artificial flavors are not your friends. No matter how great they smell, just remember the natural ones work even better. And don’t forget these chemicals dry out your lips. Chemical sunscreens: Chemical sunscreens show up a lot in lip balms with SPF. However, they are notorious for causing allergic reactions, which will just result in dry lips. Avoid lip care products with oxybenzone, octinoxate, and homosalate. Natural Ingredients you must include in your lip care routine. Now that you know what not to use, it’s time we fly to the positive wing of our lip care routine. The best way to soothe and care for your lips is to include nutrient-rich ingredients in your lip care routine. Below are a few elements we love to use in our lip care products: Shea butter The most important function of any lip care product is to keep our lips moisturized and help prevent chapped lips. For centuries, women around the world have relied on Shea Butter for soft and nourished lips. The high concentration of fatty acids and vitamins allows this effective emollient to heal dry lips and help us achieve nourished and healthy lips. Whether it’s the dry winter winds or the hot summer heat, the anti-inflammatory properties of Shea butter make it our go-to shield to avoid cracked and dry lips. Natural oils Natural oils like coconut and hemp seed deliver nutrients and healthy fats to your lips. It helps them stay naturally smooth and nourished. These oils also help treat dry skin, making it easier and faster to heal chapped lips. At least one of your daily lip care products must feature natural oils. Sugar Sugar is a gentle and natural way to exfoliate dead skin cells from your lips. In addition, it will help keep your lips soft and supple. So say goodbye, dry lips! And did I mention it tastes great too? Sunscreen Our lips are more delicate than our skin which means they need more robust protection. Use a daily lip care product with protective ingredients like avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide. Daily lip care routine for dry lips Yes, you read it right! You need a proper daily lip care routine if you want to never worry about dry lips again. So without further ado, let’s find out what is the best lip care routine for soft and supple lips: Remove makeup Never to sleep with any make-up on; make that a rule of thumb. Clean off any remaining lip gloss, liner, or lipstick from your lips before going to bed. It helps your skin to breathe. Don’t be harsh. Gently clean the makeup with a wet cotton ball. Scrub your lips with sugar If you want your lips to feel soft and look plump, don’t skip out on the exfoliation step of your lip care routine. We have already discussed why sugar is a significant element to inculcate in your lip care routine. Scrubbing twice a week will get rid of dead skin cells and the chapped lips with it. Your skin isn’t the only part that requires regular exfoliation; your lip care routine is incomplete without an excellent sugar scrub. Make lip balm your best friend. We don’t need to tell you how vital a good lip balm is for healthy and plump lips. Even the slightest change in climate can cause our sensitive lips to dry out. So having a creamy and hydrating lip balm with you can make a world of difference for your delicate drying lips. A hydrating lip balm feels great on your lips, and it doesn't hurt that they smell heavenly. However, it’s essential to use a suitable lip balm for your lips. Lip balms with phenol, menthol and salicylic acid should be avoided as they dry out your lips the more you apply them. It’s a vicious cycle; better not to fall into it. Instead, try sticking to natural ingredients-laden lip care products. Try our Hemp Seed Oil & Shea Butter Lip Balm to experience the goodness of shea butter on your chapped lips and keep dry lips at bay. It’s the best lip balm for dry lips. Massage your lips Gently massaging your lips daily with natural oils for a couple of minutes can help increase blood circulation. This helps in getting the pout-worthy pink lips that everybody loves. Stay hydrated 24/7 Can we leave our lips alone for 8 hours at night without worrying about waking up with dry lips? Sadly, the answer is No. So we need to ensure our lips stay hydrated even when we are asleep. The only way to ensure that is through an effective night lip care routine. First, make sure you put on a hydrating lip balm before going to bed so that you wake up with soft, smiling lips instead of dry and cracked ones. Conclusion Your lips lack the sebaceous oil glands found elsewhere on your skin. This sets them up for dryness and chapping. A regular lip care routine can help keep your lips soft and smooth. Look for a lip balm with ingredients like shea butter. Use it anytime your lips feel dry. Exfoliate dry lips twice per week using sugar scrubs, and follow it up with a balm. And don’t forget your SPF before stepping out. A good lip care routine is the backbone of beautiful soft pink lips that we so desperately wish for. FAQs Does lip scrub make lips pink? Scrubbing gets rid of dead skin cells leaving the skin soft and smooth. In addition, it increases blood circulation making your lips appear more pink and plump. Can I use lip scrub every day? No, using a scrub every day is not recommended as it leaves it raw and over- sensitive. You can scrub your lips twice a week but no more than that. Do dermatologists deal with lips? Yes, dermatologists deal with lips. If none of your lip care efforts are bearing any fruit leaving your lips severely dry and bleeding, you can consult a dermatologist to treat it. Why do I pick my lip? The continued picking can develop into a condition called a skin-picking disorder or excoriation. People with this disorder pick at their skin out of habit or impulse. They often describe this impulse to pick as something they struggle to control. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is an effective treatment for this disorder. best lip care routine, daily lip care routine to get rid of dry skin, lip balm for dry lips Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

With so much information readily available from all possible sources, everyone seems to know a lot about skincare. But do you know about the ingredients that work for your skin type? Continue reading to learn about the ideal ingredients to use for your face care. Best Face care Ingredients for Dry Skin Hyaluronic Acid It is a holy grail ingredient for dry skin . Look out for products with hyaluronic acid. If your face seems dehydrated, now is the time to include hyaluronic acid in your face care routine. It absorbs faster in the skin. It is one of the most popular ingredients in the beauty world. Regularly using hyaluronic acid-based products on your face will help keep it hydrated while plumping and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, making you seem younger. The first product to try is Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serum , which combines the benefits of both hyaluronic and Vitamin C components for additional protection. It's light and effective, and if you have pigmentation or dark spots, this serum is for you. Apply this serum to a damp face and follow with a hyaluronic moisturizer to seal in the moisture and keep your skin looking moisturized all day. Ceramides Let's start with a definition of ceramides. We're confident many people would look up the name on the internet to learn more about it. So stay with us, and we'll provide you all the information you require. Ceramides aid in the restoration of natural skin barriers and the retention of moisture. It is produced naturally by your skin, but production decreases with age, seasonal changes, or the use of too many harsh cleansers or exfoliants. Ceramide deficiency is characterized by dry skin. Therefore, several products on the cosmetics market may be used topically to replicate the body's natural ceramide production. Consider using our hyaluronic and ceramide face wash in your regular face care routine , as it will prevent your skin from drying out when you're washing your face. In addition, it will keep your skin moisturized. After a shower, apply a moisturizer to your damp skin right away to help it absorb the moisture. Kokum butter and Argan Oil Our Argan & Rose Day Cream has both of these skin-loving ingredients. In addition, both of these ingredients are beneficial to dry skin. As you know, Kokum Butter, which has been used to soften skin for centuries, serves as a balm for dry, cracked, and rough skin, repairing and restoring suppleness. On the other hand, Argan Oil is a light-textured oil rich in vitamins and antioxidants that help minimize acne inflammation and regulate natural oil production. In addition, it works to restore skin suppleness and is ideal for hydration. Hibiscus and Saffron Do you have a hard time deciding which night cream to use? Our Hibiscus and Saffron Night Cream is a good choice. Your skin will thank us later as it is a great product to add to your nighttime face care routine if you use it regularly at night. This cream, enriched with skin-firming and antioxidant-rich hibiscus and saffron extracts, works as you sleep to leave you with smooth, supple, and moisturized skin. Best Face care Ingredients for Oily skin Oily skin generates excess sebum than other skin types. As a result, oil secretion comes with different problems like whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, and acne. Salicylic Acid It is an effective acne-fighting ingredient. Salicylic acid is a kind of most common BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid). It continues to be used extensively in the cosmetic industry, an oil-soluble substance that penetrates deeper into the skin's pores. On the face, it works effectively for blackheads and whiteheads. It's like a potent magic elixir that can be incorporated into your daily face care routine . In addition, it doubles up as an exfoliator. Some of our favorite products with salicylic acid include Glycolic & Salicylic Acid Serum - Because of the powerful components in this serum, it effectively unclogs pores while also treating acne pigmentation and age spots. Tea Tree & Salicylic Acid Face Wash - salicylic acid is combined with the antibacterial properties of tea tree oil to treat acne and prevent future outbreaks. Retinoids The primary function of retinoids is to decrease the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. However, it also works well to reduce large pores produced by excess sebum production in acne-prone skin. You should take full advantage of this ingredient and incorporate it into your nighttime face care routine to know about its benefits. Start using our Retinol & Peptide Serum once or twice a week at first. Then, you can progressively increase the frequency of usage to alternate days, depending on how well it suits your skin. Must-Have Ingredients for Normal Skin Normal skin doesn't imply you don't have or won't have skincare issues that you need to address today with an excellent daily face care regimen. Although you may not see indications of sun damage from not using sunscreen or other skincare issues caused by seasonal weather changes, environmental stress, or age-related changes, they are still pursuing you.

It shouldn't be tough to take care of your face. It's best to stick to a simple cleaning, toning, and moisturizing routine. Each face care routine can be personalized and will be unique, depending on your skin type. But as skincare has become trendier and its definition has become more comprehensive in scope, it's also gotten a little more intimidating and confusing for a beginner to get started. You may gradually incorporate serums and retinol into your routine as your CTM improves. The goal is to stick to your routine to notice any differences in product usage. How Can I Glow Up? It's never too late to start a routine that you can stick to without any fuss. In addition to following an AM and PM face care routine, it is essential to exercise regularly and limit the intake of junk and oily food to avoid pore-clogging.

Let us help you choose the best Hyaluronic acid serum for your skincare needs. Despite being a mouthful, even skincare novices have heard about Hyaluronic Acid - a hydration superhero . But apart from that one detail, what exactly do we know about this ingredient? Before introducing a new ingredient to your skincare regime, it's essential to know all about it. To make it a little easier for you, we have compiled all the essential details about adding the best Hyaluronic acid serum to your daily skincare routine. Give it a read and the hope is that you will be quite an expert on the ingredient and all the Hyaluronic acid serum benefits. What is Hyaluronic acid? Sparing you the trip to Google to look up wordy terms like glycosaminoglycan, let me simplify it. Hyaluronic acid is a robust hydrating agent. That pretty much sums it up. Naturally present in our body, Hyaluronic acid is easy to absorb for the skin cells. It heals, protects, and puts moisture into the skin to give it a hydrated and plump look. Hyaluronic acid has several profound skin benefits other than its outstanding hydrating qualities. Hyaluronic acid is a potent antioxidant that protects the skin against free radicals, owing to which it's a star ingredient in a plethora of skincare products. From cleansers to moisturisers, HA is everywhere. You can include any hyaluronic acid-infused product in your skincare routine to get the benefits of this healing humectant, or you can include an all-rounder Hyaluronic acid serum. Serums are the most efficient channel to introduce your skin to the benefits of hyaluronic acid. Serums are the secret accelerators that help in providing our skin with nutrients quickly and directly. The raw and active concentrate is easier to absorb for the skin and is packed with the ingredient’s richness. It will introduce you to the skin altering Hyaluronic acid serum benefits. If you want to enjoy the numerous benefits of hydrating Hyaluronic acid quickly, then a HA serum is your best bet. What to look for in a Hyaluronic Acid Serum? For all the magic Hyaluronic acid serum does for your skin, it's essential to understand not all hyaluronic acids in the market are created the same. That implies they all don't do the same job. Here are three critical components of a quality Hyaluronic acid serum for face that you should be looking for: A Well-Balanced Concentration Quality over quantity? Well, in this case, quantity is quality! Most of the Hyaluronic acid serums contain only 0.25%-1.75% hyaluronic acid. These are somewhat hydrating for your skin, but they will not be amazingly effective because the concentration is very low. Running off to get the highest concentration of Hyaluronic acid serum for face? Hold off your horses as HA attracts all the water molecules, and with high concentration, it might end up sucking water from your skin, leaving your skin dehydrated and wrinkly. So what concentration of Hyaluronic acid to opt for? Well, if you are wondering whether there's a number that you can look for, there is! The percentage of Hyaluronic acid to look for in a Hyaluronic acid serum for face is just over 2%. A 2% concentration of HA in serum is a well-balanced concentration that keeps your skin hydrated with an additional perk of you looking stunning! Different Forms of Hyaluronic Acid Yes, you read it right. There is more than one form of Hyaluronic acid. However, a healthy mixture of the three primary kinds of Hyaluronic acid helps you achieve the best results. Higher-weight molecules don't penetrate the skin deeply, which means they stay on the skin, making your skin look super plumped and hydrated. Medium-weight molecules help you retain moisture just below the skin's barrier and have a semi-long term effect. Small-weight molecules dive deep down, addressing fine lines, wrinkles, and skin elasticity. As a result, these molecules help create healthy, happy skin in the long term. A perfectly balanced fusion of all three molecular forms delivers what we hope to achieve by applying the best Hyaluronic acid serum: healthy, hydrated and dewy skin. Other Ingredients That Make Our Skin Glow Some Hyaluronic acid serums are only composed of Hyaluronic acid and water. While this combination is entirely safe to use on its own, it's not optimal. Pairing active ingredients with Hyaluronic acid can make a Hyaluronic acid serum go from ’good’ to ‘fantastic’: The best ingredient to pair with Hyaluronic acid serum Vitamin C is one of the best partners Hyaluronic acid could ever ask for! Vitamin C is loved for its protective powers against oxidative stress and its compatibility with all skin types. This power-packed duo can boost each other's efficacy, leaving you with smoother, brighter, and healthier skin. Whether it's a Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic acid or the way around, it’s equally effective. Best Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C Serum Neemli's Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum is the best one to give your skin some serious love and care all year-round. Suitable for all skin types, this serum is an explosive blend of effective ingredients that work cohesively to bring your skin alive. While Vitamin C acts as antioxidant, rejuvenating skin cells and reducing fine lines, Hyaluronic acid draws in moisture to the skin, making it plump and smooth. In addition, the non-greasy serum is light on the skin, making it the first choice of those who want to incorporate a non-fussy serum into their morning skincare routine. Key ingredients: 12% Vitamin C: Vitamin C is renowned for its extraordinary ability to even skin tone and brighten ageing skin. It also prevents the appearance of dull patches and dark spots. Hyaluronic Acid: Hyaluronic acid provides long-lasting hydration at a cellular level and helps you achieve plump and dewy skin free of dullness, wrinkles, and fine lines. Niacinamide: Niacinamide boosts the immunity of sun-damaged skin and helps regulate the natural oil flow of the surface. It also reduces hyperpigmentation and visibly brightens an otherwise dull complexion. Aloe Vera Leaf Extract : Aloe Vera Leaf extract gives the serum a gel-like consistency, making it easy to apply. A deeply hydrating humectant, it also helps in improving acne-related problems. How to use Hyaluronic acid serum? For optimal results, Hyaluronic acid serum must be applied evenly on your face and neck right after cleansing and toning while the skin is still damp. Next, cover your face with moisturiser to lock in the moisture-retaining serum. It's better to ask how to use Hyaluronic acid serum for face than to misuse it and lose out on the abundant Hyaluronic acid serum benefits. Conclusion Hyaluronic acid serums have become a staple in daily skincare regimes around the world. Mainly because they’re suitable for all skin types and the effects are visible in just a few weeks of use. Consistent application of Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serum guarantees desirable and long-lasting results. So without further delay get the best Hyaluronic acid serum and enjoy healthy and hydrated skin. Frequently Asked Questions Should I use Hyaluronic acid every day?

Unless you live in some magical universe where your skin cleans itself, the answer will be “forever.” Even the laziest of human beings follow this one step as part of a healthy skincare routine. But what they fail to realize is that not every cleanser is created the same, and neither is our skin. So we must select a cleanser that is best suited to cleanse our skin type. But before we dive into the numerous types of face cleansers, let's ensure we understand this effective skincare product. What is a cleanser? Anything that cleans our skin is a cleanser. So whether it’s raw milk or a face wash , as long as it helps get rid of all the impurities inhabiting our skin, it’s a cleanser. It’s the first step of every skincare routine and the most crucial one too. Cleansers clean our face and make it ready to absorb the products that feature in the next steps of our skincare routine. Hence, it’s essential to nail this initial step to optimize our skincare efforts. How can you improve your cleansing technique? We generally don’t pay heed to fads, but the double cleansing trend has won our approval and hearts. What is double cleansing? Well, it’s kind of self-explanatory. Double cleansing is cleaning your face twice. Gone are the days when cleansing only entailed cleaning sweat and dirt off your face. Cleansers today have to first remove the makeup off your face before getting to the skin’s surface. If you wash your face just once to clean your makeup-clad face, the cleanser’s efforts are solely directed towards clearing your face of the foundation layers. So the face cleanser doesn't get the opportunity to reach the deeper layers of our skin, exposing them to a number of skin problems. That’s the primary reason why in spite of following daily skin care routines religiously we often find ourselves dealing with frequent breakouts. Double cleansing is our way around it. It’s the way to attack skin harming elements twice over. Double Cleansing Method Step 1: In this step, you clear all the makeup and dirt covering your face priming it for deeper cleansing. Step 2: Once the skin is free of all the outside elements, it’s time to go deeper into the skin’s layers to extract all the impurities from your pores. Double Cleansing Products Micellar water and oil-based cleansers work brilliantly as the initial cleansers whereas Cream and clay cleansers are the ideal choices for the second step. When choosing the double cleansing products for the second cleanse, it's wise to go for a gentle face cleanser as it goes deep within our skin and a harsh cleanser would leave your skin feeling agitated. In the contaminated environment we live in, double cleansing is a potent way of protecting our skin. Given the indisputable effectiveness, if you have oily skin, you must pivot to double cleansing for oily skin problems. With the right face cleanser and an effective double cleansing method adopted in your daily skincare routine , your skin will efficiently overcome problems like irritability, redness and acne. Now, Let’s dive into the different cleansers and choose the one suitable for your skin type and skincare needs. Types of cleansers Gel Cleansers Ideal for: Oily, acne-prone skin If you are looking for the best face cleanser for oily skin, then your search ends here. Gel cleansers are a treat for oily skin as they are gentle while deep cleansing clogged pores. As the name suggests, Gel cleansers come in a gel-like consistency and are known for their deep cleansing properties. Gel-based cleansers are the ideal contenders to battle acne-causing bacteria and getting rid of excess oil. Though it doesn’t give the extra foam while cleansing that we are used to, its effectiveness as a cleanser eclipses any other reservations one might have regarding it. Foam cleansers Ideal for: oily and combination skin If you love the frothy feel of bubbly foam on your skin, then you will have a blast using the foam cleansers. They are super effective in clearing the skin of any dirt, makeup, and pollution, leaving your skin feeling tight after every use. After every wash, foam cleansers leave your skin feeling cleaner and clearer. However, the foam is caused by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a skin-drying-irritant that can leave your skin dry and irritated. Hence, always check for a foam cleanser that’s SLS-free. Cream cleansers Ideal for: Dry and sensitive skin Cream cleansers have their own fan group. A must-have for dry skin, cream cleansers hydrate the skin as they perform the cleansing action. Cream cleansers leave your skin feeling softer and smoother. However, cream cleansers aren’t effective in removing all the makeup and pollution your skin accumulates. Instead, you can use cream cleansers in your double cleansing routine. Using a makeup remover or micellar water to clean makeup and impurities and then applying the soothing cream cleanser to get that extra cleanse and hydration is the perfect way to treat your skin after a hectic day. Clay cleanser Ideal for: Oily, combination, sensitive skin. Mattifying clay cleansers are expert exfoliators that deeply cleanse our pores and absorb all the impurities, dirt, and excess oil from the skin. However, they are not equipped to remove makeup. So it’s advisable to double cleanse when opting to use clay cleansers. Oil cleansers Ideal for: Dry skin, normal skin and combination skin. The concept of putting more oil on oily skin may not make sense, but oil cleansers contain an oil base to help extract dirt on the skin without interfering with the skin barrier. The oil from your skin works in sync with the cleanser to balance the skin. An oil cleanser is a gentle way of removing pore-clogging debris, including waterproof makeup, without drying out your skin. Oil cleansers are primarily used for their brilliant ability to clear all the makeup layers from your skin without being harsh on your face. Our Top Cleansers: Hyaluronic & Ceramide Face Wash : The Neemli Hyaluronic & Ceramide Face Wash is completely sulphate free and provides gentle cleansing without irritation to sensitive skin. The power-packed humectant Hyaluronic acid penetrates the skin and infuses it with moisture providing long-lasting skin hydration. Ceramides are fat molecules that help skin retain moisture and protect against environmental stressors. Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash The Neemli Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash is expertly curated for those with oily, combination and acne-prone skin looking for a gentle cleanser that helps reduce breakouts without stripping the skin of its natural oils. Tea tree oil helps reduce sebum production and fight acne, while salicylic acid deep cleans the skin with its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. If you want a cleanser equipped with the power to care for your acne-prone skin, then the Tea Tree and Salicylic face wash must be on your bathroom shelf. Rice Water & Hemp Seed Oil Makeup Remover The Neemli Rice Water & Hemp Seed Oil Makeup Remover uses a mix of skin-loving ingredients that remove makeup gently while soothing and caring for your skin. Rice water provides the skin with a boost of vitamins and minerals, while hemp seed oil, rich in omega fatty acids, helps in hydrating and soothing skin. It's not just a makeup remover; it’s a soothing cleanser your skin will grow to love. Conclusion One small step can change the way your skin feels, for better or worse. Fortunately, in our case, it’s for the better. We are well acquainted with the importance of a healthy cleansing routine. But it’s time we understood the importance of choosing skincare products specially formulated to treat our skin type to maximize its benefits. Now that you are well acquainted with different face cleansers, choose the best face cleanser for your skin. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between a face wash and a cleanser? There is no significant difference between a face wash and a cleanser. Both are equipped with cleansing ingredients. A face wash is a cleanser. Is Rosewater a cleanser? Rosewater is packed with numerous skincare benefits, but it cannot be used as a cleanser on its own. Instead, it’s an excellent natural toner and hydrator which can be used after cleansing your face with a skin type-specific cleanser or face wash for maximum benefit. Can I use a cleanser every day? No matter what skincare routine you follow, you must wash your face with an effective cleanser at least once every day. Ideally, you should wash your face twice a day to keep your skin clean and safe from dirt, impurities, grime and environmental stressors. Which is better: Scrub or Cleanser? While face scrubs and cleansers both cleanse your skin and leave it refreshed, they provide different benefits for your skin. Cleansers are gentle solutions to remove oil and debris from the skin's surface. Scrubs offer a deeper cleanse by removing dead skin cells and unclogging pores. Cleanses are meant for everyday use, while scrubs should be used once or twice a week as they can be harsh on the skin. double cleansing method, double cleansing products, face cleanser, skincare routine Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

From when to apply face serum for glowing skin to which face serum is the best for your specific skin type: let’s decode the mystery of face serums. What is a face serum? We are well aware that serums are super effective solutions that help in levelling up our otherwise basic skincare routine. But other than that, what exactly is a face serum? In simple terms, face serum is a formula that contains high volumes of active ingredients. When applied to the face, they are highly equipped to penetrate deep into the skin layers and address specific skin problems. Face Serums have the unique ability to target one or a combination of skin concerns. In addition, unlike cleansers and moisturisers, serums champion the concentration of a single ingredient allowing it to address specific skin needs quickly. Face serums are like energy boosters for your face; a small dose is powerful enough to jet you across the line. Several different face serums are being introduced every day to treat specific skin problems, given their laser focus approach. How to use a face serum If you have spent hours scrolling through the skincare products section, then you know how overwhelming it can be to figure out the correct steps for your skincare routine. Do face serums go on before the toner or after? Can we skip moisturiser if we use face oil? Can we apply face serums at night? Figuring it all out on your own can be quite daunting and not to mention exhausting. However, skincare is supposed to be soothing and all about self-care, isn't it? It still is, you just need the right guide! The first thing you need to understand is the correct order in which face serum is applied. The exact order to apply skincare products in your daily routine Cleanser Never apply a face serum unto an unwashed face. If you don’t heed to anything else, I say, please listen to this one piece of advice: Take off your makeup and wash your face before applying your daily skincare products. Using products on an unclean face is not only useless but can also be detrimental to your skin’s health. AM or PM? Cleansers are supposed to be used in the morning and the evening after you come back to your nest after a kickass day! In the Morning Use a gentle and soothing cleanser to wash off excess oil, dirt and sebum off your skin. For oily and acne-prone skin Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash is our recommended choice and if you have dry or combination skin Hyaluronic & Ceramide Face Wash is likely to work wonders for you. In the Night Use an oil-based makeup remover to gently clean makeup and grime from your face and neck. Then follow it with a gentle and creamy face wash. Neemli’s Rice Water & Hemp Seed Oil Makeup Remover uses a gentle dual action that cleanses while hydrating and softening skin. Enriched with rice water and hemp seed oil, it eliminates all leftover makeup residue and leaves you with soft, soothed and bright skin. Face Toner There’s a lot of unnecessary confusion regarding the order of face toner and serum. So it’s time to clear the air: (Pay attention) Face Toners must be applied before serums. There, I said it! A toner is a super light hydrating formula that prepares our skin for serum application. Facial toners remove all skin barriers like the remaining traces of dirt and makeup, allowing the serum to penetrate the skin’s layers easily and effectively. AM or PM? Anytime you wash your face, follow it up with a toner. So yes, a toner too, should be used twice a day like cleansers. Neemli’s Witch Hazel & Vetiver Pore Refining Facial Toner helps with refining pores, clarifying skin and getting skin balance back by restoring pH levels which makes it ideal for all skin types and our favourite choice in skin refining toners. Ensure your toner is fragrance and alcohol-free. Face serums Serums- ah! The heavy lifters of our skincare regime. Face serums are the power boosters of our skincare regime. Apply the serum evenly on your face and neck and wait for 90 seconds to let it absorb into your skin properly before following the next step. Am or PM? Your skin needs the nourishment face serums to provide, in the morning as well as in the night. However, the needs of our skin differ depending on the time of application. In the morning If you want a face serum for glowing skin , then Vitamin C is the answer to all your prayers. Every skincare expert swears by the staggering benefits of using a good Vitamin C face serum, especially in the morning. A V itamin C Face Serum for glowing skin protects your skin from inflammation and irreversible damage caused by environmental stressors during the day while also brightening skin and lightening dark spots over time. In the night The use of skin correcting products and makeup during the day coupled with the environmental stressors your skin is exposed to leaves your skin dry and irritated. Your skin needs active hydration to cope with this stress. Hence, you should opt for a hydrating hyaluronic acid serum in your night skincare routine. However, buying two different face serums for daily use seems too extravagant, doesn’t it? But what if we could find a serum that gives us the best of both worlds? Best Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid Neemli’s Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum is a potent blend of the two most effective skincare ingredients. Vitamin C serum with hyaluronic acid protects your skin as it brightens and plumps skin tissue to keep it soft and dewy smooth. Vitamin c serum with hyaluronic acid is exactly what you need to boost your skin and your skincare routine. Moisturiser Now it’s time to lock in the products on our skin to f prolong their life and secure their effectiveness. How do you do that? By applying a layer of moisturiser. Moisturisers create a protective shield that hinders outside pollutants from coming in direct contact with the skin. It also locks the moisture with the chain of skincare products applied to the skin. Am or PM? Moisturisers are hydrating agents that win them a place in our daytime as well as a nighttime skincare routine. How to apply face serum? And now we’ve finally unlocked the answer to the most asked question: how to use face serum? Once you have cleansed and applied toner on your face, take a pea-sized amount of serum and spread it evenly on your face and neck. If you are using a dropper, then 2-3 drops will do the trick. Even though many people misuse serum as a moisturiser, remember it’s not one. So don’t slather it on your face as you do with moisturisers. Instead, lightly cover your face with the skin-boosting serum to get the most out of it. There are two ways in which you can apply the serum to your face. Both are equally effective; depending on your convenience, choose one. Using Fingertips The first way is to apply the serum using your fingertips. Take the serum and apply it to your face and neck. Then, gently tap, pat and smooth the serum out. However magical the serum feels, it’s not Aladdin’s lamp, so avoid rubbing and tugging it; Serums don’t need your help to penetrate the skin, thanks to its liquid-gel-like consistency. Using palms The second way is to take some serum onto your palm. Then, Gently rub your palms to warm and activate the serum. Next, gently press your palms onto your skin and pat the serum on, in outwards and upwards motions until it’s fully applied to your face and neck. Choosing the best serum for your skin While most serums are created to benefit all skin types, it’s advisable to start by choosing one that’s curated for the skincare concern you’d most like to address. Whether you want to reduce the appearance of dark spots, boost radiance, firm skin or smooth the look of fine lines, there’s a serum out there that’s created specifically for you. Let’s explore the different types of serums and their respective benefits to choosing the one for your skin. Acne-Fighting serum Adding an acne-fighting serum to your acne-treating skincare routine equips your skin with enough firepower to remove even the possibility of a breakout. The concentration of sugarcane derived Glycolic acid makes for an excellent anti-acne serum. In addition, glycolic acid helps in declogging gunk from pores that lead to acne when left untreated. Another ingredient that works wonders in the battle against frequent breakouts is salicylic acid. A salicylic acid serum is the best face serum for oily skin that you must add to your wishlist if you have acne-prone skin. Neemli’s Glycolic & Salicylic Acid Serum will prove to be a smashing addition to your anti-acne club. Infused with the two most potent ingredients to treat and prevent acne, the Glycolic and salicylic acid serum is the best face serum for oily skin. It unclogs pores, removes excess oil and exfoliates dead skin cells eliminating every possibility of a breakout and giving you a clear radiating glow. Bid goodbye to acne. Anti aging serum When we talk about anti aging serums , we have to mention Retinol. Anti aging serum and Retinol go hand in hand. A synthetic derivative of vitamin A, Retinol often stars in anti-aging creams and is aptly referred to as an “age-defying” and “anti-wrinkle” ingredient. The reparative retinoid sinks into your skin to speed up cell turnover, causing your body to churn out fresher, less wrinkled skin over time. Advised to be included in your night skincare routine, Retinol must be gradually blended into your skincare routine as your skin takes time to adjust to it. Retinoids trigger collagen production and cellular exfoliation, which means they’ll also fade dark spots, smooth scars, clear pores, prevent breakouts, and brighten skin. To sum it up, Retinol is the closest thing to ‘derma’ magic. Best Retinol Serum in India Anyone above the age of 30 must have a retinol anti-ageing serum on their nightstand. Neemli’s Retinol & Peptide Serum is the best Retinol serum in India. With collagen-stimulating Retinol and firming peptides, this serum combines powerfully effective ingredients that help combat hyperpigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, giving you smooth, younger-looking skin without any irritation. Conclusion Face serums are power-packed skin boosters that you can’t live without once you start using them. Now that you know how to apply a face serum for glowing skin, remember that the proper order of skincare products must be followed for optimal results. Make a note: Always use face serums on clean, toned skin and lock it in by applying moisturiser. While Vitamin C serum is compatible with all skin types, a Salicylic and glycolic acid serum works wonders for oily and acne-prone skin. And how can we forget the age-defying retinol serum that has taken over the anti-ageing sphere of skincare products? Now that you’re a serum pro, pick the suitable face serum for your skin and work it into your skincare routine. Frequently Asked Questions Can I apply serum daily? Yes, Serums can be applied daily. In fact, it is advised to use face serums twice a day for optimal results. Before adding a new product to your skincare routine, always do a patch test to check if it suits your skin. Is serum a moisturizer? Yes, and No, serums can be full of moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid but it’s not a moisturiser in the traditional sense of the word. Serums are designed to penetrate deeply into the skin to deliver targeted active ingredients, whereas moisturizers help to strengthen the surface of the skin and work at the surface of the skin to boost hydration. Which serum is best for the face at night? Any serum with hydrating Hyaluronic acid or age-defying Retinol works wonders for the face at night. Neemli has a range of effective serums that star impressive ingredients like hyaluronic acid and retinol making them the best serums for the face at night. Retinol & Peptide Serum is the most effective serum for your night skincare routine. face serum for glowing skin, face serum for oily skin, face toner, how to apply serum on face, how to use face serum, vitamin c face serum Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

The only thing that got us through those painful trials of the teenage breakouts was the solace in the thought that “it’s just a teen thing.” Guess what- it’s not. “Adult acne” is a thing, and it doesn’t discriminate between the sexes. Women and Men both suffer from the trials of adamant adult acne. Adult acne is not that different from teenage acne in its makeup, but it’s harder to get rid of. But before we decode how to get rid of acne, it’s essential to understand what causes acne in men. Causes of Acne in Men Excess oil We have all experienced or at least heard that oily skin is more susceptible to acne. But if oil is the problem, why doesn’t everyone with oil-producing sebaceous glands get acne? Oil isn’t necessarily the cause; it’s the excessive production of oil that invites a plethora of problems. The excess oil clogs pores and creates a blockage in the follicle which eventually turns into acne. Sebum blockage is one of the most prominent causes of acne in men. Although, unlike women, men pay scarce attention to the makeup of their skincare products. Your skin needs to be treated with skincare products specifically designed for oily skin to get rid of excess oil. When treated with products that aren’t curated for oily skin, it dries your skin out, making your oil glands change into hyper gear mode and accelerate oil production. Either way, it’s detrimental to your skin health. The Neemli30 AC-NAY KIT FOR OILY SKIN is specifically designed to combat recurrent acne; this expertly curated routine helps reduce breakouts and whiteheads to give you clearer, more even-toned skin. Okay, So an unwanted extra ton of oil is the culprit. But why do we end up with these overactive sebaceous glands? Is there a lottery that we don’t know about where the winners get away with shiny, plump oil-free skin? Let's find out; Reasons you develop excess oil: Hormonal imbalance: Oh, these hormones! Why couldn’t they stop at mood swings? But, unfortunately, they have to meddle with our skin health too. It’s a direct relationship where the slightest fluctuations in testosterone levels result in increased oil production. This secretion when coupled with a clogged follicle, leads to dreadful bacterial overgrowth, causing inflammation and acne breakouts. Genetic Predisposition: If your parents had adult acne , chances are the apple will follow the same acne-riddled course. Even though your genes don’t meddle with the sebaceous glands, they just program your cells to be over-sensitive to testosterone. So even normal levels of testosterone trigger the oil factory resulting in oily skin and frequent breakouts. Abnormal Shedding of dead skin cells Not many people know this, but your skin constantly sheds dead skin cells. So right this second, layer of dead skin cells is being cast off your skin, paving the way for newer and fresher skin cells. This desquamation is normal; the alarm goes off when this process goes awry, and your skin starts hyper-producing dead skin cells four to five times its normal rate but cannot shed it at the same rate. The excess dead skin then sits on your face clogging your pores, resulting in inflammation and acne. Did You Know? Most of the dust in your house is made up of dead skin cells. Proliferation of Bacteria Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) are bacteria routinely found on most skin. In those with acne, the P. acnes population grows out of control. The bacteria create a conducive environment for breakouts. However, the presence of (P.acnes) does not indicate the lack of hygiene; it results from sebum blockage, which stems from excess oil. How to Prevent Acne in Men Treating adult acne is a daunting process full of experimental treatments, home remedies, and plenty of frustration. Well, the good news is we have finally unlocked the treasure of effective ways to prevent acne. It’s similar to the techniques women have mastered over the years, but we have scoured the scripture for our reluctant male readers and streamlined the process. After probing through the causes of acne, we have learned that the root cause of acne developing is blockage of pores with either excess oil or dead skin cells. So to ensure we never have to encounter the dreadful torturers we call adult acne ever again, we need to find ways to keep our pores unclogged and smooth. That breaks the mission into two phases: Keeping the oil on our skin in check Ensuring the dead skin cells don’t remain on our skin Let’s get the answer to how to prevent acne ; Ways to Prevent Acne Wash your face twice a day Our best bet against oily skin is an effective and gentle oil-free face wash. Wash your face in the morning and the evening without fail, to clear excess oil and dirt. A good face wash will help you clear your skin of unnecessary stressors like extra oil and free radicals, but a great cleanser will assist your skin in building balance while keeping the oil production in check. If you don’t want to spend a chunk of your time following a 9-10 step skincare routine every day, you better invest some time and resources in finding the right cleanser for your skin . Pay attention to this: Look for a face wash with salicylic acid as it’s not just a tried and tested weapon against acne but a skincare expert’s most recommended plan of action for preventing acne and controlling excess oil. Neemli’s salicylic acid face wash calms and sanitizes the skin, leaving the skin feeling clean, fresh, and ready to take on the day. Start Exfoliating I’m tired of convincing men to start exfoliating; it’s not that hard and takes less time than shaving. Still, they fail to understand the importance of this simple activity. Pay attention because this will most likely change your life! Exfoliation is the guaranteed solution for getting rid of dead skin cells before they get a chance to wreak havoc in our skin’s ecosystem. Exfoliants like glycolic, lactic, and malic acids do a great job clearing your skin of all the dead weight, leaving your skin soft and smooth. Washing your face is not enough to effectively clear your pores and peel off the blanket of dead skin cells lounging on your skin. Instead, it needs a good scrubbing. Make it a habit to exfoliate your skin every time you shave, given that you shave every three days. Keep Your Hair Clean. If excess oil in the hair travels to the skin, it can worsen acne. Wash your hair regularly, and be careful not to let hair spray and other hair products come in contact with your skin. They can worsen your acne. Be cautious while Shaving. Facial hair and acne don’t do well together. Facial hair on men can become a breeding ground for bacteria and rap oil—all facilitating the development of acne. We know how much you love your beloved beard, so we have some precautionary measures that can help. This one’s kind of obvious but nonetheless crucial. Use a clean razor to shave. Moisturise before and after shaving. If you have a breakout after you shave, try using an electric razor next time. Get an antibiotic foam that you can mix with your shaving cream to help prevent breakouts. Razor Bumps If razor bumps are an issue for you, shift to an electric razor and don’t shave too closely. Always be mindful of acne near your facial hair. Refrain from shaving off your pimples even by mistake. It’s just going to make it worse and not to mention extremely painful. These simple precautions can save you the exhausting ordeal of treating acne, which we all know is no cakewalk. In addition to the preventive measures we mentioned above, following a daily skincare routine has proved effective in preventing and even treating acne. A daily skincare routine might sound cumbersome, but it’s just a fancy way of saying to take care of your skin regularly. Skin Care Routine For Men Cleanse The most essential step in the skin care routine for men and preventing adult acne is effectively cleansing your skin. Any regular cleanser won’t do; you need a cleanser packed with robust acne-fighting ingredients like Tea Tree oil and Salicylic acid. Neemli’s Tea Tree & Salicylic Face Wash has both these ingredients along with skin-clearing Glycolic acid. Tone (Optional) Toners are the elves that quietly get the job done while other products get the limelight. An exfoliating toner is the recommended choice for acne-prone skin. Unlike harsh scrubs, it gently exfoliates your sensitive skin and deeply cleanses your pores. Choose a Toner that's alcohol-free as it irritates the skin and worsens the already fragile balance. Glycolic Acid & Apple Cider Vinegar Exfoliating Toner is alcohol-free and known for its stunning pore-cleansing properties. Glycolic acid has the unique ability to go deeper into the skin, promoting skin cell renewal by effectively exfoliating the upper layers of the skin. And on the other hand, Apple Cider Vinegar helps increase the blood flow to the skin, minimizing the appearance of pores while balancing the skin’s pH and fighting acne-causing bacteria. This power-packed Glycolic acid toner is the perfect addition to your acne-fighting skincare routine . Apply Serum If you belong to the group that believed washing your face was equivalent to skincare, then naturally, all these steps of the skincare routine for men will feel a little overwhelming. But trust us, it’s all worth it because your skin not just deserves but, at this point, needs all the care and pampering it can get. Serums are the speed posts that swiftly deliver active skin-enhancing ingredients directly to your skin, accelerating the skin-improving process. Our Glycolic & Salicylic Serum is specially formulated for acne-prone skin. A multi-functional superstar, it controls bacteria and clears dead skin cells while also soothing with minimal irritation to sensitive skin. Men’s Moisturiser Even rugged men can have smooth, moisturized skin; it’s time we stop hurting our skin because of imaginary rules of masculinity. Moisturised skin is healthy skin. Men’s Moisturisers are swarming the market as more and more men realize the importance of moisturising in keeping the skin healthy and young. Men’s Moisturisers provide a protective layer that prevents dust and other environmental impurities from coming in direct contact with our acne-affected skin while simultaneously locking essential moisture into the skin. And while treating acne, it becomes more important to use a moisturiser as acne-treating products often dry your skin. Sunscreen for men Applying Sunscreen isn’t just a tropical holiday requisite; it’s a Sine qua non for protecting our acne condition from worsening. Sunscreen for men pretty much serves the same purpose as Sunscreen for women; prevent dark spots, sun damage, and signs of aging. Sunscreen for men can protect acne-clad skin from the unforgiving UV- rays of the sun and other environmental elements. A good Sunscreen for acne prone skin can give a mattifying effect and protect the skin without worsening breakouts like our Natural Spf 30+ Mattifying Sunscreen . For oily and acne-prone skin, we have a daily essential duo combo with a Hyaluronic and oat moisturiser and Natural mattifying Sunscreen at a concessionary price. Acne Treatment for Men Now that you are all caught up on the causes of acne and ways to prevent it, it’s time we get acquainted with how to treat it once you inevitably get it. Treating acne is often a tedious and lengthy process that requires patience. You can’t start an acne treatment and get dejected if it doesn’t show results instantly. Retinol Therapy The unique ability of Retinol to boost cell turnover makes it a gold standard to treat and prevent acne. In addition, Retinol is a robust agent that peels dead skin cells, preventing clogged pores which is the prominent reason behind the formation of new pimples. Not just that, Retinol products help in decreasing oil secretion as it shrinks sebaceous glands over time. Whether in the form of Retinoids or retinol products, retinol therapy shows excellent results in treating acne. As we discussed earlier, it takes time, but the results are worth the wait. Spot Treatment For Acne Pits and Scars Spot treatment on blemishes and acne can help clear them out without leaving any scars on your skin. When your body doesn’t produce enough collagen, pits or scars may form while the skin heals. If you’re looking for a non-invasive but effective, yet gentle treatment and prevention remedy, your search ends here. Glycolic Acid & Hydrolyzed Collagen Pit Repair Concentrate is formulated especially to work on repairing pits and uneven skin texture . Consult A Dermatologist Over-the-counter acne products can help if you have minor blemishes. But if your acne refuses to budge even after trying OTC products, it’s time to contact your dermatologist. There are plenty of prescribed acne medications available that can help. With the proper medications, you will be well on your way to clear skin . Conclusion Adult acne is a severe problem that afflicts women and men alike. It’s not enough to just treat acne when they occur and then forget about it. Once you get rid of those painful bumps on your face, continue with the healthy habit of following a daily skincare routine, so you don’t have to greet these troublemakers every other week. Preventing acne is a continuous process where keeping your skin healthy and balanced is crucial. Cleansing and exfoliating are central to it. Follow the tips we discussed on how to get rid of acne religiously, and the results will follow! Frequently Asked Questions Does ice remove pimples? When used on inflammatory acne, ice has the potential to decrease redness, thereby making your pimples less noticeable. However, don’t apply ice directly to your skin; place it in a cloth and then use it on your pimples. Should you pop pimples? Popping your pimple can cause inflammation and scarring, which takes a lot more time to clear up than a pimple would have taken to be treated. Is my razor causing acne? Shaving doesn't cause acne, but it can cause razor bumps which look like acne. Razor bump is typically caused by the use of a dull, clogged, or dirty blade. Always use a clean blade and moisturise your skin before and after shaving. How to get rid of acne fast? Treating acne is a process that takes some time. You need to give it a minimum of 2-3 weeks to completely heal. While over-the-counter gels and creams can help treat acne, following a consistent skincare routine curated for fighting acne is the most effective and long-lasting way to get rid of acne. daily skincare routine, how to get rid of acne, skin care routine for men, sunscreen for men Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

Veganism is abstaining from all products derived from animals like meat, dairy, wool, honey, etc. However, veganism is not just about what’s on your fork; it’s so much more than that. Vegans refrain from using animal products and ingredients in all parts of their lives. That includes their clothes, footwear, and, oh yes, beauty and skincare products! Vegan skin care is transitioning into the mainstream skincare industry, thanks to the global awakening for a better and more sustainable lifestyle. Vegan V/S Cruelty-Free Skincare Isn’t vegan and cruelty-free the same? Well, ideally, it should be, but unfortunately, it’s not. Cruelty-free products are not necessarily vegan, and vegan products might not be cruelty-free. Confusing, right? The Cruelty-free mark signifies that the product has not been tested on animals, while vegan products are created without including any animal-based ingredient. Both are champions of animal rights and positive steps towards a better and sustainable skincare industry. Why Is Vegan Skin Care Better? Plants are the topmost source of nutrients and good-for-you antioxidants, so no matter what, vegan skin care is a win for your skin! Vegan skin care isn’t just better for animals, but it’s better for your skin too. How, you ask? Vegan products provide you with a whole array of hidden benefits and can leave your skin and conscience feeling better. Let’s explore the goodness of switching to vegan skincare. Kinder To Animals Along with a vegan diet, choosing vegan skin care is kinder to animals as they do not involve animal-derived ingredients and are usually produced without animal testing. So if you can’t switch to a vegan diet but want to contribute to the betterment of animals, then vegan skincare can be a path for you. However, keep in mind, being vegan-friendly doesn’t guarantee that these products haven’t been tested on animals. If the label reads cruelty-free then it’s not been tested on animals. Gentler For Your Skin Vegan skin care is not only kinder to animals, but it is for your hair and skin as well. It is a little known fact that much of what we put on our skin is absorbed by our body, and plant-based ingredients are rich in vitamins and minerals. In addition, they are rich in antioxidants and are less likely to irritate or aggravate your skin conditions. Better For The Planet As per the recent reports by the UN environment program, animal-derived products are a key cause of environmental damage that includes climate change, water depletion, soil erosion. The list goes on. But switching to veganism will ensure that you lead a more sustainable and eco-friendly life. Since nature takes such good care of us, it is only fair that we give back too. Animal Based Products Commonly Used in Skincare products: Whenever you adopt such a drastic change in your lifestyle, it takes a lot of courage and hours of scouring the literature and internet to learn as much as you can about the transition. If you are looking for vegan skincare products, it’s essential that you are aware of the animal-based ingredients commonly used in beauty and skincare products. It will help you narrow down your search. Beeswax Honey bees Collagen Chicken Feet Keratin: Feathers, horns, quills, and hair of animals. Squalene: Shark liver oil Glycerine: Animal fat Lanolin: Sheep Stearic acid: Animal fats Elastin Arteries, lungs, intestines, and skin of mammals Honey: Bees Silk: Wasps, bees, ants, butterflies, etc However, having a brand you can trust can make a world of difference to streamline your efforts.

So you make the best out of the situation and end up on the Google search result page of \" how to get rid of dark circles.” But even after a million tips and hacks, you still find the panda eyes staring back at you. Even though exhaustion and loss of sleep are contributing factors to our undereye bags, it’s also a matter of genes. Those cucumber slices are hardly a match for your genes. Am I telling you that the reason behind your puffy raccoon eyes is your parent’s thin skin? Pretty much! But before you rush off to your dermatologist and sign up for an expensive laser or needling treatment, take a beat and go through our list of non-invasive ways to get rid of dark circles. Below are ways to minimize the appearance of those dark circles that won't cost you your kidney. Reasons For Dark Circles And How To Get Rid Of Them Even though there is an inheritance factor, it’s not the only reasons for dark circles. From allergies to your irregular sleep schedules, anything can cause dark circles under your eyes. If the cause of your dark circles is thin skin, then use a Retinoid. Blood vessels become more visible when you have thin skin, highlighting your dark circles. Retinoids have been proven effective in stimulating collagen production, which helps make skin more plump, reducing the appearance of dark circles. Retinoids help rebuild and tighten the skin, making it look younger and firmer. The skin around your eyes is the first to show signs of aging; incorporating retinoids in your skincare routine can help decelerate these signs. Neemli’s Retinol & Peptide Serum helps combat hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles giving you smooth, younger-looking skin without any irritation. If Sun damage is the culprit, then you need a Stronger Sunscreen Increased exposure to the sun accelerates the natural process of collagen breaking down, leading to skin thinning. So to protect the skin and, more importantly, the delicate skin under our eyes, we need to be diligent in our sunscreen application . Neemli’s Natural Spf 30+ Mattifying Sunscreen is a fast-absorbing, non-pore blocking, water-resistant sun shield that provides safe, long-lasting protection from UVA and UVB rays. It’s smarter to use double protection, so take those stylish sunglasses along to keep unpleasant dark circles at bay. If you have dark circles because of increased pigmentation, Vitamin C is your savior. Often the reasons for dark circles are increased pigmentation either from incessant rubbing or sun damage. It’s like, is there any problem that’s not somehow our own fault? (We feel you!) As far as pigmentation is concerned, a power-packed Vitamin C serum can go a long way in boosting skin brightness. Antioxidant-rich Vitamin C helps in treating hyperpigmentation and brightens your skin in the process, making those gnarly dark circles less visible over time. Neemli’s Hyaluronic & Vitamin C Serum is a light, non-greasy age-defying daily use serum that helps treat pigmentation. It brightens and plumps skin tissue to keep skin smooth, soft, and even. If your eyes are often puffy and stressed then, it’s time you start using an under eye cream for dark circles. The most significant contributor to those under eye bags and dark circles is a lifestyle of constant stress and worry. Stress has become a constant nowadays, but that doesn't mean dark circles have to be too. An effectual under eye cream for dark circles is what your skin needs to treat the nasty effects of stress. As the under-eye skin is highly delicate, ensure the cream is made of clean ingredients and is gentle in its approach. Neemli’s Caffeine and Cucumber under eye cream for dark circles is armed with stimulating caffeine and refreshing cucumber seed oil to target the stubbornness of the area to leave your under eyes looking bright, fresh, and smooth. Try Sleeping on your Back This one is perhaps the easiest tip to help you get rid of your dark circles. All you have to do is sleep, just in a different position. When you sleep on your side or stomach, blood pools under your eyes thanks to gravity, making your eyes puffier and dull. Solution? Start sleeping on your back with an extra pillow under your head. If your eyes just need to feel refreshed, then give the below-mentioned home remedies for dark circles a try: Cucumbers Gifted with high astringent properties, Cucumbers can soothe your eyes and brighten those dark circles naturally. If you want to speed up the process, try opting for an eye cream with cucumber as its active ingredient. Cold Tea Bags Green tea is an excellent antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe strained capillaries in your under-eye area. To use cold tea bags as a compress, soak a tea bag in clean water and then place it in the refrigerator for half an hour. Then, place the tea bag on your eyes. Keep the bags on your eyes for 10 minutes daily and wash the area with warm water afterwards. Rose Water The freshness of rose water is enough to convince me to use this natural toner. But if you need the long list of benefits, rose water has a couple of those too. Like cucumber, Rosewater is a mild astringent, and it helps soothe and rejuvenate tired, dull-looking skin. Just soak cotton pads in rose water for a couple of minutes, and then let the soaked makeup pads sit on your closed eyelids. Leave them for about 15 minutes twice daily. Tomatoes Tomatoes can help cure dark circles. Well, haven’t you ever used tomatoes to de-tan? Tomatoes have a high proportion of lycopene, a substance that is great for your cardiovascular health as well as your skin. Lycopene helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and brighten your skin. Dip a cotton pad in a concoction of tomato juice mixed with lemon juice and keep it under your eyes for 30 minutes. Then, rinse it with warm water. Ensure the lemon juice doesn't go into your eyes. Try these effective home remedies for dark circles. Remove Dark Circles With One Healthy Habit At A Time. Taking care of your skin is a constant process, and a big step in that process is embracing healthier habits. Healthy lifestyle changes are the stepping stone to healthy skin that’s strong enough to take care of itself. Habits like exercising regularly, drinking adequate amounts of water daily, meditation for stress, and the most important one: Getting 8 hours of quality sleep every night. Inculcate these healthy habits slowly in your life and soon you wouldn’t need to run a search on getting rid of dark circles. Conclusion Dark Circles can be caused by a variety of factors that can be taken care of by effective skincare steps. And while these tips tackle your baggy eyes situation, your makeup can take care of those dark rings around your eyes. Now that you know all that there’s to know on how to get rid of dark circles, let’s get to know the best under eye cream a bit better. Frequently Asked Questions Are dark circles bad? Dark circles under the eyes usually aren't a medical problem. However, it’s an indication that you need to make your skin health a priority. Can aloe vera remove dark circles? While there’s no proof that aloe vera cures dark circles, it’s a natural emollient that helps to improve inflammation, which reduces dark circles. Can coconut oil reduce dark circles? There’s no specific evidence to suggest that coconut oil can completely get rid of dark circles. However, it does have anti-inflammatory properties that can temporarily lighten them. Does massaging eyes get rid of dark circles? Massaging can help boost your blood circulation and reduce dark circles by bringing fresh oxygen to your under-eye area. how to get rid of dark circles, reasons for dark circles, under eye bags, under eye cream for dark circles Older Post Newer Post Shop About us Discover Sign in Privacy Policy Refund and Returns Policy Shipping Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Us Disclaimer Terms of Service Refund policy Annual Return Follow us Subscribe to our newsletter © Neemli Naturals.

It's more prevalent in women and is often triggered by hormonal changes, such as pregnancy or the use of hormonal birth control. While melasma is not a serious condition, it can be distressing for many people, affecting their confidence and self-esteem. Fortunately, there are several treatment options available, including Tranexamic Acid, a powerful ingredient that can help to fade dark spots and even out skin tone. What is Tranexamic Acid? Tranexamic Acid is a form of the amino acid lysine, which is known for its ability to inhibit the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to our skin. Melanin production is often overstimulated in people with melasma, leading to dark spots and patches on the skin. Tranexamic Acid works by blocking the activity of enzymes that stimulate melanin production, thereby reducing the appearance of dark spots and improving skin tone. How does Tranexamic Acid help with Melasma? Tranexamic Acid is an effective treatment option for melasma because it targets the underlying cause of the condition, which is the overproduction of melanin. It not only helps to fade existing dark spots but also prevents new spots from forming. Studies have shown that Tranexamic Acid can significantly improve the appearance of melasma, with visible results within just a few weeks of use. 10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate by Neemli Naturals If you're looking for a product that contains Tranexamic Acid, the 10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate by Neemli Naturals is an excellent option. This potent concentrate is specifically formulated to target dark spots and hyperpigmentation, including melasma. It contains a blend of powerful ingredients, which work together to fade dark spots, brighten the skin, and improve skin texture.

In conclusion, melasma can be a challenging condition to deal with, but with the right treatment, you can achieve an even, radiant complexion. Tranexamic Acid is a powerful ingredient that can help to fade dark spots and improve skin tone, making it an excellent choice for those with melasma. The <a href=\" https: title=\"10% Tranexamic Spot Correcting Concentrate\">10% Tranexamic Acid Spot Correcting Concentrate by Neemli Naturals is a high-quality product that contains Tranexamic Acid and other beneficial ingredients, making it an effective and safe option for those looking to improve the appearance of their melasma.
